<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Secret War</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uchiha Clan had always known about the Anitsu Clan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the rest of the shinobi world saw the Anitsus as
merely another Kekkei Genkai clan with their mysterious Wave Style, the Uchiha<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>masters of the Sharingan
and Genjutsu<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>recognized
something far more dangerous: the Wave Style was the perfect counter to their
visual prowess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Anitsu Clan's ability to manipulate vibrational waves
extended to brain waves. Their techniques could disrupt the very chakra flow
that Genjutsu required, shattering illusions before they could take hold. A
master of Wave Style could literally vibrate their own neural pathways to break
any Genjutsu, and at higher levels, could emit wave pulses that destabilized an
opponent's chakra network<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>rendering
even the Mangeky<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
Sharingan's most powerful illusions useless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku Uchiha, leader of the Uchiha Clan and commander of
the Konoha Military Police Force, had watched the Anitsu Clan with growing
concern throughout the Third Great Ninja War. While Konoha and Kumo were
officially enemies on the battlefield, Fugaku understood that true clan
security meant eliminating threats before they became problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Wave Style represented an existential threat to Uchiha
dominance. If knowledge of their counter-Genjutsu capabilities spread, or if
the Anitsus ever allied fully with Konoha's enemies, the Uchiha's greatest
weapon<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>their Sharingan<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>would be neutralized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the Third War ended in the Year of the Ten-Tails (the
same year Minato Namikaze became the Fourth Hokage), Fugaku made his decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Night of Broken Waves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was called &quot;Operation Silent Tide&quot; by the
Uchiha strike team<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
covert assassination mission disguised as a rogue attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku selected twelve of the Uchiha Clan's most elite
warriors, including three from the Military Police Force and four ANBU
veterans. They moved under cover of a diplomatic mission to the Land of
Lightning, officially there to negotiate post-war reparations. In reality, they
carried black-market Kumo headbands and Lightning Release techniques<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>prepared to frame the
attack as an internal Cloud Village power struggle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nayuta Anitsu, age 28, was the clan head and a master of
Wave Style. He had fought in the Third War alongside the Fourth Raikage,
earning the title &quot;The Resonance Shield&quot; for his ability to disrupt
enemy Ninjutsu with precision wave pulses. His wife, Nyoko Anitsu, age 26, was
the clan's chief medic and a genius at internal wave therapy<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>using vibrational healing
that could mend shattered bones and purify poisoned blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were young, powerful, and deeply in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had a son<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nanzo<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>who had just turned one
year old. He had his father's wild black hair and his mother's striking yellow
eyes, the pure golden orbs that marked true Anitsu blood. He was already
showing signs of the clan's Kekkei Genkai, his baby giggles sometimes causing small
ripples in the air around him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The attack came at 3:00 AM, during the new moon when the Anitsu
Clan's wave-sensitivity was at its lowest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku himself led the strike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Massacre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Anitsu compound  was located on the eastern cliffs of
Kumogakure, built into natural resonance chambers that amplified their Wave
Style. The Uchiha struck the guard posts first<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>three
Jonin-level Anitsus eliminated before they could emit warning pulses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nayuta woke to the sound of his wife's scream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He found Nyoko already in combat stance, their bedroom door
shattered, three Uchiha standing in the doorway with Sharingan spinning. Nanzo
was in his crib, wailing, his yellow eyes wide with terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Uchiha,&quot; Nayuta snarled, his hands already
forming seals. &quot;You dare<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wave Style is a threat to the natural order,&quot;
Fugaku said, stepping from the shadows. His Mangeky<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> Sharingan<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>rare
even among the Uchiha<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>glinted
with deadly intent. &quot;Your clan's ability to disrupt Genjutsu cannot be
allowed to spread. This is not personal, Anitsu. This is survival.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The battle was catastrophic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nayuta unleashed the full power of his Wave Style, creating
a Resonance Field that shattered the Uchiha's initial Genjutsu attempts. The
air screamed as vibrational pulses tore through the compound, collapsing walls
and rupturing the eardrums of two Uchiha strike members. Nyoko grabbed Nanzo
and fled through a secret passage, her own Wave Style creating a Vibration
Barrier that deflected a Fire Style: Great Fireball.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Fugaku had prepared for this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uchiha team had studied Anitsu Techniques  for months.
They knew the 15-minute cooldown between major Wave Style techniques. They knew
the 5-meter blind spot where wave pulses couldn't reach without harming the
user. They knew that Anitsu Clan members, for all their power, were vulnerable
to physical speed in close quarters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku activated his Mangeky<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>'s
special ability<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;Kamunagi&quot;
(Divine Tool of the Gods)<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
technique that allowed him to predict wave patterns by reading the subtle
chakra fluctuations in the air. He could see Nayuta's attacks coming before
they formed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Nayuta's first major technique<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Wave Style: Internal Organ Rupture<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>killed four Uchiha
instantly by liquefying their lungs, Fugaku simply wasn't there to be hit. He
had already moved, closing the distance to the 5-meter dead zone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your waves can't touch me here,&quot; Fugaku said, his
voice cold as he drove a Chakra Blade through Nayuta's heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nayuta died with his wife's name on his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nyoko's Last Stand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nyoko ran through the secret tunnels beneath the compound,
clutching Nanzo to her chest. Her son's terrified cries echoed off the stone
walls. Behind her, she could hear the Uchiha pursuing<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>eight of them still alive, including their
monstrous leader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She reached the Emergency Resonance Chamber<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a sealed room designed to
protect the clan's children during attacks. Three other Anitsu children were
already there, huddled with their mothers: Nora (age 8), Kiyoshi (age 12), and
Mei (age 6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nyoko-sama!&quot; Nora cried, seeing the blood on her
clan head's wife. &quot;Where's Nayuta-sama?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Gone,&quot; Nyoko said, her voice breaking. She handed
Nanzo to Nora<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;Protect
him. He's the last heir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned to face the tunnel entrance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nyoko-sama, no!&quot; Kiyoshi grabbed her arm.
&quot;Come with us! The emergency exit<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The exit takes five minutes to open,&quot; Nyoko said
softly, touching the boy's face. &quot;They'll be here in thirty seconds. I can
give you four minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She kissed Nanzo's forehead. Her baby boy, who would never
remember her face. Who would grow up an orphan, raised by the survivors in this
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wave Style: Final Resonance,&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The technique was forbidden<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Waver
Mode's lesser cousin, a suicide technique that burned the user's life force to
create a zone of absolute vibrational chaos. Nyoko's body began to glow with
golden light as she poured every ounce of her chakra, her life, her love for
her son into one final pulse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uchiha burst into the chamber just as the wave released.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku's eyes widened. &quot;Scatter!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Too late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Final Resonance created a shockwave of pure vibrational
force that tore through the tunnel system. Three Uchiha were instantly killed<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>their brains turned to
jelly by the frequency. Two more lost their eyes as the Sharingan lenses in
their sockets shattered. The remaining three, including Fugaku, were thrown
back, their bodies broken, their chakra networks disrupted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nyoko Anitsu died standing, her body dissolving into golden
particles of light, her final wave continuing to pulse through the compound for
four full minutes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>blocking
all pursuit, protecting the escape route.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her last thought was of Nanzo's smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Rescue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The explosion of chakra<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>unique
to the Anitsu Clan's Wave Style<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>alerted
the entire Hidden Cloud Village.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A the Fourth Raikage was in his office when the sensors
screamed. He recognized the signature immediately<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nyoko's
Final Resonance, a technique only used when the clan was facing extinction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Killer B! Darui! Cee!&quot; he roared, already moving
at lightning speed. &quot;The Anitsu compound <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>NOW!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They arrived to find smoke and death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uchiha strike team<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>what
remained of it<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>was
trying to retreat through the eastern cliffs, carrying their dead and wounded.
Fugaku, his right arm shattered by Nyoko's wave, was limping, his Mangeky<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> bleeding from overuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A the Fourth didn't hesitate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Lightning Style: Lariat!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blow caught the lead Uchiha<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a Jonin named Teyaki<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and snapped his neck instantly. Killer B was
next, his Lightning Release: Double Lariat decapitating another. Darui's Black
Lightning struck from the sky, turning two more Uchiha into charred corpses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku faced the Raikage with seven dead clan members at his
feet and his own body broken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is an act of war, Uchiha,&quot; A growled,
lightning crackling around his fists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then let it be war,&quot; Fugaku spat, blood dripping
from his mouth. &quot;Your Wave Style users are dead, Raikage. We eliminated
the threat. Whatever children survive will never reach their parents' potential<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not without masters to
teach them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He activated a Space-Time Ninjutsu scroll<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a forbidden technique
stolen from the Nara clan archives<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and
vanished with the remaining two survivors, leaving his dead behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A wanted to pursue, but the cries of children stopped him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Emergency Resonance Chamber, they found them: four
survivors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora (age 8), clutching baby Nanzo, her yellow eyes wide
with trauma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kiyoshi (age 12), his arm broken, trying to be brave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mei (age 6), catatonic, rocking back and forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Nanzo Anitsu(age 1), the clan heir, his golden eyes
staring blankly at the blood on Nora's hands<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his
mother's blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ninety-seven percent of the Anitsu Clan<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>over 200 men, women, and
children<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>dead in one
night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Aftermath</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hidden Cloud Village went into lockdown. The Fourth
Raikage wanted to declare war on Konoha, but the Kage Council intervened.
Without proof that the attack was officially sanctioned by the Hokage<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and with the Uchiha dead
left behind wearing stolen Kumo headbands<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
incident was buried as a &quot;tragic internal accident&quot; caused by
&quot;rogue elements.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku Uchiha returned to Konoha and reported the mission as
a &quot;preemptive strike against a hostile Kekkei Genkai threat.&quot; The
Hokage and Council, wary of Cloud Village's growing power and unaware of the
full scope of the massacre, officially reprimanded but secretly approved the
elimination of a dangerous rival clan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth was buried so deep that even most Uchiha didn't
know of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only Fugaku and the two survivors carried the secret<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and the trauma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Survivors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora Anitsu, age 8, became Nanzo's primary caregiver. Too
young to be a mother, but old enough to remember Nyoko's final sacrifice, she
raised Nanzo with a fierce devotion that bordered on obsession. She taught him
to control his Wave Style, to never show weakness, to hate the Uchiha with
every fiber of his being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She never told him the full truth<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that his parents died protecting him, that his
mother's last act was a suicide technique, that the Uchiha leader Fugaku
personally murdered his father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not until he was old enough to understand the burden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kiyoshi Anitsu became  a Jonin and the clan's military
instructor, but he never recovered from the trauma. He died five years later
during a routine mission<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>officially
an accident, but those close to him knew it was suicide by combat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mei Anitsu never  spoke again. She lived in the rebuilt
compound as a caretaker, tending to the shrine of the dead, her mind
permanently broken by the massacre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Nanzo?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He grew up knowing only that he was special, that he was the
last heir, that he had to be perfect. He grew up with Nora's love and her
hidden grief, with the weight of 200 dead on his tiny shoulders. He grew up
learning Wave Style from the only teacher left, mastering Wind Style through
sheer genius, developing his Gravity Manipulation through physics textbooks<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>because there were no other
Anitsus to teach him the advanced techniques.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He grew up alone, the &quot;Prince&quot; of a dead clan,
beautiful and white-skinned and yellow-eyed in a village of dark-skinned
warriors, surrounded by the ghosts of his people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Until Karui came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Until she saw through the perfect exterior to the broken boy
beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Until she bit his neck and claimed him, not knowing that the
scar she left mirrored the one Fugaku's blade left on his father's corpse<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>both marks of domination,
one of death, one of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Legacy of the Massacre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Anitsu Clan massacre remained one of the Hidden Cloud
Village's darkest secrets. The Fourth Raikage kept the Uchiha bodies in a
sealed vault as evidence, waiting for the day when Kumogakure might need
leverage against Konoha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo learned the full truth on his 10th birthday<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the same day the Second
Great Ninja War began in the original timeline, but in this Waver Universe, the
day Nora finally told him everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn't cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He went to the clan shrine and sat before his parents'
memorial tablets for three days without eating or sleeping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the fourth day, he emerged with a new determination: he
would rebuild the Anitsu Clan. He would master every technique his parents
never had the chance to teach him. He would become so powerful that no one<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Uchiha or otherwise<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>would ever threaten his
people again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he would do it without Waver Mode, the technique that
killed his mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because Nanzo Anitsu understood , even at age 10, that
suicide techniques were not power<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>they
were surrender. And he refused to surrender.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not to the Uchiha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not to fate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not to anyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10 years later In the Hidden Cloud Village, where 70% of the
population bore dark skin like the earth and sky of their rugged homeland,
Nanzo Anitsu was an aberration. A walking contradiction. A pale, beautiful boy
with yellow eyes that seemed to glow in the dark, surrounded by a village of
dark-skinned warriors who looked at him with suspicion, envy, or pity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At age ten, the mockery had already hardened into armor:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hey, prince! Lost your castle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The academy bullies<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>dark-skinned
boys with Lightning Release prowess<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>would
corner him during lunch. They never touched him. They knew better. Even at ten,
Nanzo's Wave Style could rupture eardrums, could make their insides vibrate
with nausea. But words were safe. Words they could use freely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your parents died because they were too weak to
protect you, white boy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That one came from a Jonin instructor who had fought
alongside Nayuta and Nyoko and resented their &quot;precious&quot; son
surviving when better shinobi died. Nanzo said nothing. He went home and
vomited blood from stress<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>Wave Style
chakra eating at his own organs when his emotions ran too high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Uchiha should have finished the job. At least
Fugaku had the guts to kill your kind properly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That was the worst. That was the one that kept him awake at
night, staring at the ceiling of the rebuilt Anitsu Compound, listening to Nora
toss in her sleep in the next room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>eighteen now,
trying to be a mother to a boy who remembered his real parents' faces in
nightmares. Nora, who had held him at age one while their clan burned, who had
raised him on stories of Nayuta's strength and Nyoko's sacrifice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora, who never told him the full truth about why the Uchiha
came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The White Minority's Whispers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the 30% light-skinned minority of Kumogakure, Nanzo
was simultaneously prized and pitied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The elders of the few remaining pale-skinned clans would
visit the Anitsu Compound, offering &quot;condolences&quot; that tasted like
opportunity:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Such a shame about your parents, young Nanzo. But
perhaps... perhaps the Anitsu bloodline would be safer merged with our clan?
Your yellow eyes are so pure. It would be a tragedy to see them diluted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They wanted his genes. They wanted the Wave Style. They saw
him as a resource<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>the last male heir of
the only Kekkei Genkai clan in Cloud Village, beautiful and white and
vulnerable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That dark maid who raises you<span style='font-family:
SimSun'>—</span>Nora, was it?<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>she's
done her best, I'm sure. But a proper family, a proper white family, could give
you so much more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo learned to smile at these visitors. Learned to bow and
thank them for their concern. Learned to activate his Wave Style just enough to
make the air hum unpleasantly until they took the hint and left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then he would go to his room and scream into his pillow<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>screams that vibrated with chakra, that
shattered glass, that brought Nora running with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why did they kill them?&quot; he would demand, every
night, as if the universe owed him an answer. &quot;Why did Fugaku murder my
parents? Why did the Uchiha hunt us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora would hold him and lie: &quot;I don't know, Nanzo. I
don't know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She knew. She had always known. Shibai's whispers. The
secret war. The threat of Wave Style to Genjutsu. But she was eighteen and
broken and trying to protect the last piece of her family from becoming a
monster of hatred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So Nanzo grew up hating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not the village<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>he
was too smart for that. The dark majority mocked him, but they also feared him.
The white minority coveted him, but they also needed him. No, his hatred had a
specific, laser-focused target:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uchiha Clan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku Uchiha, who had driven the blade through Nayuta's
heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The strike team that had hunted his mother like an animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sharingan users who saw his clan as a threat to be
exterminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He studied them obsessively. Learned their techniques, their
history, their weaknesses. Planned<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>at
age ten, he planned<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>how he would kill
them when he was strong enough. How he would find Fugaku and make him feel Wave
Style internal destruction. How he would eradicate the Uchiha the way they had
eradicated the Anitsus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the only thing that kept him going some days. The
hatred. The promise of vengeance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The News Arrives</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a rainy Tuesday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was in the compound's small library<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>really just a room with salvaged scrolls<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>studying Wind Style theory when he felt it.
A shift in the village's chakra atmosphere. Tension. Whispers. Running feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked to the window, yellow eyes narrowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Jonin he recognized<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>Darui,
young but already marked for greatness<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>was
sprinting toward the Raikage's tower, his face pale. Behind him, other shinobi
gathered in clusters, speaking in hushed, horrified tones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo activated his Wave Style sensory technique<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>Pulse Reading<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>and
felt it:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shock. Disbelief. Fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something had happened. Something big.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He found Nora in the kitchen, hands shaking as she prepared
tea she wouldn't drink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nora. What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked at him<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>really
looked at him<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>and he saw something he
didn't understand. Relief? Guilt? A terrible, complicated emotion that made her
look younger and older at once?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo... sit down.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Konoha. The Uchiha Clan.&quot; She swallowed.
&quot;They're... gone. All of them. Massacred. In one night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words didn't make sense. &quot;Gone? What do you mean
gone?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Dead. Murdered. By one of their own, they say. An
Uchiha named Itachi. He killed them all<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>his
parents, his family, his clan. Children. Elders. Everyone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo stared at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His first thought was: Fugaku is dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His second thought was: I didn't kill him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His third thought<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>the
one that exploded through his chest like a Wave Style rupture<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>was: Someone else did my vengeance for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, rising through the shock like a bubble through
deep water, came an emotion he didn't expect:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pure, terrible, relieving joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Liberation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo didn't go to his room. He didn't scream. He didn't
cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked out of the compound<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>past
the gates, past the guards who called out to him, past the village streets
where dark-skinned shinobi stared at the pale boy walking in the rain with a
smile on his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked to the cliffs. The eastern cliffs, where his
parents had died. Where the Uchiha strike team had cornered them. Where Nyoko
had burned herself to ash to save him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there, in the rain, looking out at the endless clouds
that gave Kumogakure its name, Nanzo Anitsu laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It started as a chuckle. Then a giggle. Then full-throated,
hysterical laughter that echoed off the rocks and made the birds scatter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Itachi!&quot; he shouted to the storm.
&quot;ITACHI!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn't know the name. Had never heard it before today.
But he shouted it like a prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You did it! You killed them! You killed them
ALL!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He fell to his knees in the mud, still laughing, tears
streaming down his pale face<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>tears of
relief, not grief. For the first time in his conscious memory, the weight of
hatred lifted. The burden of vengeance<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>of
planning, of dreaming, of needing to kill<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>evaporated
like mist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fugaku Uchiha was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The strike team was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clan that had hunted his family, that had reduced his
people from hundreds to four, was erased from existence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And not by his hand. By one of their own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nanzo whispered to the rain, to the
ghost of a boy he'd never met. &quot;Thank you, Itachi.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Respect</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the weeks that followed, Nanzo learned everything he
could about Itachi Uchiha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The information was fragmented<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>Konoha
kept its secrets, and the massacre was a wound they covered with silence. But Kumogakure's
intelligence network was thorough, and Nanzo had resources. He was the clan
head, even at ten. People answered his questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He learned:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Itachi was thirteen<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>only
three years older than Nanzo.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Itachi was a prodigy<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>ANBU
captain at age eleven, ch<span style='font-family:SimSun'>ū</span>nin at ten,
the greatest genius of his generation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- Itachi had spared one person<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>his
younger brother, Sasuke, left alive to &quot;hate him, to grow strong, to kill
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo thought about that last part for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He thought about what it meant to kill your own family. To
make that choice. To carry that weight. To be willing to be hated for the rest
of your life, to let your only surviving relative grow up dreaming of your
death, all for... what?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For peace, the whispers said. To prevent a coup. To stop a
war. To protect the village from the Uchiha's planned insurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo didn't believe that. Not entirely. No
thirteen-year-old killed their entire family for abstract political stability.
There had to be more. Deeper reasons. Darker truths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But whatever the truth, one fact remained: Itachi had done
what Nanzo could not. He had looked at his clan<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>the
people who raised him, who shared his blood, his eyes, his techniques<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>and he had judged them worthy of extinction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he had acted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He's stronger than me,&quot; Nanzo told Nora one
night, staring at the intelligence reports spread across the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora looked worried. &quot;Nanzo... you can't admire him.
He's a monster. A mass murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes,&quot; Nanzo agreed calmly. &quot;And he's also
the reason I can sleep at night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked up at her, his yellow eyes<span style='font-family:
SimSun'>—</span>Nyoko's eyes<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>clear and
steady.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;For ten years, I've dreamed of killing Fugaku. Of
killing them all. It was the only thing that made the mockery bearable. The
only thing that made being 'The White Ghost' survivable. I was going to become
a monster to kill monsters.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He tapped the report with Itachi's face<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>a young, beautiful boy with Sharingan eyes
that held depths Nanzo couldn't fathom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He did it for me. He carried the weight for me. He became
the monster so I don't have to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora was silent. She thought of Shibai's whispers. Of her
own hatred, carefully hidden, for the Uchiha. Of how she had wanted to tell
Nanzo the truth<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>that the Uchiha
attacked because they feared Wave Style, because they were threatened, because
they were desperate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But looking at her boy<span style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>no,
her young man, sitting there with the burden of vengeance finally lifted<span
style='font-family:SimSun'>—</span>she couldn't say it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What will you do now?&quot; she asked instead.
&quot;Without the hatred?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo smiled. It was a new smile<span style='font-family:
SimSun'>—</span>not the sharp, defensive baring of teeth he used against
mockery, but something genuine. Something free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Grow strong,&quot; he said. &quot;Not to kill. Not for
revenge. Just... strong. Strong enough to protect what's left. Strong enough
that no one ever needs to become Itachi again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked out the window, toward the village that had mocked
him, that had called him prince and ghost and weak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And maybe,&quot; he added softly, &quot;strong enough
to understand why he did it. To know the full truth. To thank him properly,
someday.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 1: The Weight of White</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The morning sun rose over Kumogakure like a wound in the
sky, bleeding gold across the lightning-charged clouds that perpetually
gathered around the Hidden Cloud Village. Nanzo Anitsu stood on the balcony of
the clan compound's eastern wing, his pale fingers gripping the stone railing
with a tension that belied his calm expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was twenty years old, and he had buried his parents ten
years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Great Ninja War had taken them<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his father, the previous
clan head, struck down by Iwagakure's explosion corps; his mother, the clan's
sealing master, dying three days later from wounds that no medical ninjutsu
could heal. Ten years old. He'd been ten years old, standing in the ruins of
what had once been a clan of sixty, now reduced to four survivors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four, including himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo-sama.&quot; The voice came soft from behind him,
carrying the particular cadence of someone who had raised him from childhood.
&quot;Your tea is getting cold.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn't turn immediately. Instead, he let his yellow eyes<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>those distinctive Anitsu
Clan orbs that marked him as blood descendant<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>trace
the village below. From this height, he could see the training grounds where
dark-skinned shinobi moved through morning katas, their bodies silhouetted
against the dawn. The Cloud Village was seventy percent dark-skinned, a fact
that Nora Anitsuseemed to forget when she spoke of purity and legacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo-sama?&quot; Nora repeated, closer now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Coming, Mom,&quot; he said, finally turning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word slipped out naturally in private, as it always did.
Nora's face softened<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that
complex expression of love and grief and something else he couldn't name. She
was forty-five now, her white skin beginning to show fine lines around eyes
that matched his own. Yellow pure eye balls, the mark of their bloodline. She
had been his father's cousin, unmarried when the war came, and afterward she
had simply... taken him. Raised him. Trained him in the Wave Style that
threatened to destroy him from the inside out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your formal robes,&quot; she said, setting the tea
tray on the low table. &quot;The Raikage has requested your presence at the
summit meeting. Darui-sama wishes to discuss the border tensions with
Iwa.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo moved to the table, settling into a kneeling position
with the grace of someone who had been trained in propriety since birth. The Anitsu
Clan might be nearly extinct, but they were still nobility within Kumogakure<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the only Kekkei Genkai clan
in a village that prized strength above all else. Their Wave Style, derived
from secret <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
lineage that only the clan head knew, made them invaluable despite their
numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or perhaps because of their numbers. Scarcity created value.
Nanzo understood this intimately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Has there been word from the northern patrol?&quot; he
asked, accepting the tea with both hands<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
gesture of respect that made Nora's eyes glisten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;None since yesterday's report.&quot; She settled
across from him, maintaining proper distance. In public, she would kneel behind
him, the proper position for a maid. In private, they shared tea as family.
&quot;Omoi-san's team is due to return today. Perhaps they'll have
intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo felt something tighten in his chest at the mention of
Team Samui. Not because of Omoi, the worry-prone swordsman, or Samui herself
with her cool efficiency. No, it was the third member of that team who made his
chakra fluctuate dangerously, who made the Wave Style in his blood hum with an
agitation that had nothing to do with combat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stubborn girl from the dark majority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He set down his tea with deliberate care, remembering too
late that his fingers had been trembling. Nora noticed<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she always noticed<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but said nothing. Instead, she reached across
the table and adjusted his collar with maternal precision, her touch lingering
a fraction too long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You look tired,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Did you
sleep poorly?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I slept fine.&quot; The lie came easily. In truth, he
had dreamed of red hair and amber eyes, of a voice shouting challenges that he
couldn't answer, of gravity itself failing to hold something in place. He had
dreamed of his own helplessness, and he had woken with his heart hammering
against his ribs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora's hand withdrew. She studied his face with an intensity
that made him want to look away, to hide the things he wasn't saying. But he
had been raised to be clan head, to be perfect, to be the Prince that everyone
expected. So he met her gaze and let her see what he chose to show: duty,
composure, the mask of the Anitsu heir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The summit is in two hours,&quot; she said finally.
&quot;I will prepare your formal attire. The white silk with the wave patterns<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it emphasizes your
lineage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you, Mom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She rose, bowed properly, and moved toward the door. At the
threshold, she paused. &quot;Nanzo?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Be careful today. The Raikage's meetings... they take
a toll.&quot; She didn't look back. &quot;I worry about you. I have always
worried.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He watched her go, the door sliding shut with a whisper, and
wondered why her words felt like a warning rather than comfort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Raikage's chamber occupied the highest point of
Kumogakure's central tower, accessible only by a series of guarded elevators
and chakra-sealed stairways. Nanzo ascended alone, his formal robes<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the white silk Nora had
chosen<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>flowing behind
him like water. The wave patterns embroidered in silver thread caught the light
with each step, creating the illusion of movement, of power barely contained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two guards flanked the final doorway, their dark skin
marking them as typical Kumogakure shinobi. They bowed deeply as he approached,
showing the respect due to a clan head even one so young.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Anitsu-sama,&quot; the left guard said.
&quot;Darui-sama is expecting you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door opened onto a circular chamber with windows on all
sides, offering a panoramic view of the village and the mountains beyond.
Darui, the Fifth Raikage, stood at the eastern window, his characteristic lazy
posture belying the sharp intelligence in his eyes. He was dark-skinned like
most of the village, his hair white with age and experience, the legendary
Black Lightning crackling faintly around his fingertips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo,&quot; Darui said without turning. &quot;You're
early.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I find punctuality prevents complications.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui laughed, a low rumble that seemed to vibrate through
the floor. &quot;Spoken like a true clan head. Come, look at this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo moved to stand beside him, following his gaze to the
training grounds far below. From this height, the shinobi looked like insects,
their movements precise and deadly even at a distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Iwagakure has been testing our eastern border,&quot;
Darui said. &quot;Small incursions, nothing decisive. But persistent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Explosion Corps?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Some. But there's something else.&quot; Darui's
fingers stopped their idle crackling. &quot;They have a new weapon. Something
that disrupts chakra networks<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
sealing, exactly. More like... vibration. Frequency interference.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo felt ice form in his stomach. &quot;Wave-based?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's why I called you here.&quot; Darui finally
turned to face him, his dark eyes serious. &quot;Your clan's techniques are
unique, Nanzo. If Iwa has developed something similar, even crude, it represents
a significant threat. I need you to analyze what we've recovered.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He gestured, and a side door opened. A medic-nin entered
carrying a sealed container, which she set on the central table before
retreating. Nanzo approached it with the wariness of someone who had learned
that beautiful things often contained deadly secrets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inside the container, nestled in protective foam, was a
fragment of metal no larger than his palm. It looked ordinary<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>scorched, twisted,
unremarkable. But when Nanzo extended his chakra senses toward it, he felt
something that made his blood run cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Resonance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The metal was vibrating at a frequency that matched,
impossibly, the harmonic signature of Anitsu Clan Wave Style.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is...&quot; He stopped, choosing his words carefully.
&quot;This is sophisticated. Beyond typical Iwa engineering.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Can you counter it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo closed the container, sealing his chakra away from the
disturbing resonance. &quot;I need to study it properly. In my clan's
laboratory, with our equipment. And I need time<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>at
least a week.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You have three days.&quot; Darui moved to his desk,
retrieving a scroll. &quot;There's more. One of our patrols intercepted a
courier carrying this. It's coded, but the destination is clear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He handed over the scroll. Nanzo unrolled it, his eyes
scanning the characters that seemed to shift and blur on the page<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a sophisticated cipher, but
one that he recognized from his father's old records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's addressed to someone in the village,&quot; he
said slowly. &quot;An agent. The code references 'the white prize' and 'the
dark contamination.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui's expression didn't change, but the air around him
grew heavy with suppressed Black Lightning. &quot;The white prize. That's you, Nanzo.
The last male heir of the Anitsu Clan's main line. And the dark
contamination...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui,&quot; Nanzo finished, the name escaping before
he could stop it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your... friend.&quot; Darui's tone was carefully
neutral. &quot;The one who defeated you in that forest incident.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She is not my friend.&quot; The denial came too quickly,
too forcefully. &quot;She is... she was an opponent. A training exercise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;An exercise that left you with a permanent scar on
your neck and her with a reputation as the woman who tamed the Anitsu Prince .&quot;
Darui's lips twitched, almost a smile. &quot;The village talks, Nanzo. Even I
hear the gossip.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's hand rose unconsciously to his left neck, where
beneath the high collar of his robes, he could feel the raised skin of Karui's
bite mark. The scar that had never faded, that he touched in private moments
with a complexity of emotion he refused to name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The scroll,&quot; he said, forcing his voice steady.
&quot;It suggests Iwa has an agent in Kumogakure who wants to eliminate me, or
perhaps use me. The reference to Karui suggests they see her as... leverage. A way
to control me, or to destabilize the clan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Or they simply want to remove what they perceive as a
threat,&quot; Darui agreed. &quot;A Anitsu Clan head with close ties to one of
Killer B's students represents a significant power bloc. If they can drive a
wedge between you, or eliminate one of you...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They weaken the village's internal structure.&quot; Nanzo
rerolled the scroll, his mind racing through possibilities. &quot;I need to
warn her. Karui. She's on patrol with her team, due to return today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've already sent word. They'll be diverted to secure
quarters upon arrival, debriefed separately.&quot; Darui's hand fell on Nanzo's
shoulder, heavy with meaning. &quot;But you should know<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>there are elements in the village who agree
with Iwa's assessment. Who see your... connection to Karui as problematic. The
white minority is small, Nanzo, but vocal. And some of them have
influence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo thought of Nora, of her careful words and her love
that felt increasingly like possession. &quot;I am aware.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Are you?&quot; Darui's grip tightened slightly.
&quot;The Anitsu Clan has always been... insular. Pure, as they say. Your
father married within the clan, as did his father before him. The idea of the
clan head taking a wife from outside, particularly from the dark majority... it
threatens certain people's sense of order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui is not my wife.&quot; The words tasted like ash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not yet.&quot; Darui released him, moving back to the
window. &quot;But the village sees how you look at her. How she looks at you.
And in times of tension, such things become weapons.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo stood silent, the scroll heavy in his hands, the metal
fragment's resonance still echoing in his chakra senses. He thought of gravity
locks and cooldown periods, of the five-meter dead zone where he was helpless,
of red hair and a voice that had called him Prince even as teeth sank into his
neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I will handle it,&quot; he said finally. &quot;The Iwa
threat, the cipher, the internal politics. I am clan head, Darui-sama. I have
been trained for this since I was ten years old.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know.&quot; Darui didn't turn around. &quot;That's
what worries me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part I: The Orphan Prince</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The whispers started the day Nanzo entered the Academy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Look
at him<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>white as a ghost.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Yellow
eyes like a monster.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>The
Anitsu freak.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ten years old, clutching Nora<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s
hand, still raw from learning the truth about his parents<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span> massacre. Nanzo walked
through the Academy gates with his chin high and his heart shattered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other children were dark. Kumogakure<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s majority<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>70% of the population, the
Raikage and Killer B and all the heroes he had heard about in Nora<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s stories. They were
beautiful in their darkness, powerful in their sameness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Nanzo was white. Pale. Yellow-eyed. The last of a dead
clan, raised by a girl only two years older than him who was technically his
maid but functioned as his mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Don<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t listen,<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> Nora whispered, her own
white skin and yellow eyes marking her as his only kin. <span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>You<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>re
special. You<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>re rare.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But rare meant target.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Academy instructors were professional<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>mostly. But Nanzo saw the
hesitation in their eyes when they graded his work. The way they flinched from
his Wave Style demonstrations. The way they called on him only when necessary,
as if his very existence was a reminder of some shameful secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The children were less subtle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Hey

observationally. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>You
gonna cry if I bump you? That white skin looks soft.<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo didn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
 cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He vibrated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Wave Style pulse was uncontrolled, raw, powered by grief
and rage. It threw Darui back three meters and ruptured the water main in the
courtyard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was suspended for three days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The white minority<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
30% who clung to their <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>purity<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”—</span>whispered that the <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Prince was violent.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> The dark majority decided the
<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Prince was dangerous.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both sides agreed: something was wrong with Nanzo Anitsu .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part II: The Physics of Isolation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By age twelve, Nanzo had learned to weaponize his isolation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they called him Prince, he would be the most beautiful,
most untouchable Prince in the village.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He grew his hair long and wild<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>black
wolf hair, Nora called it, the traditional style of Anitsu Clan heads. He wore
white silk instead of the practical dark colors of Kumogakure. He walked with
perfect posture, chin elevated, yellow eyes looking down his nose at everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Good
morning, commoners,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span>
he would say, passing groups of dark-skinned students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>My
chakra reserves are beyond your comprehension. Please don<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t speak to me unless you
can calculate gravitational fields.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was intolerable. He was deliberately intolerable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mockery evolved:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>There
goes the Prince.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Think
his diaper needs changing?<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Who<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s gonna marry the white
freak? He<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s gonna die
alone and rebuild his stupid clan by himself.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Unlucky.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That word<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>unlucky<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>became his shadow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The white minority used it with spite: <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Unlucky to be born Anitsu.
Unlucky to survive the massacre. Unlucky to be so pretty and so useless.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dark majority used it with pity: <span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Unlucky kid. No parents. Raised by another
kid. Acts like a Prince because he<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s
scared.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both were wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo acted like a Prince because rage was safer than grief.
Because if he was going to be alone, he would be alone on his own terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He threw himself into physics<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
one subject where his white skin and yellow eyes didn<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t matter. Where calculations were pure and
gravity didn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t care
about clan politics. He understood wave propagation, resonance frequencies,
field theory. At fourteen, he was correcting Academy instructors on chakra
dynamics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>You<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>re smart,<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> Killer B told him once,
after a private lesson on Wave Style control. The legendary jinch<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>riki was one of the few
dark-skinned heroes who treated Nanzo as equal<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>perhaps
because B understood what it meant to be feared for what you were. <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>But you<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>re also an asshole.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Thank
you,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> Nanzo said,
perfectly composed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>I<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>m serious, little prince.
That attitude gonna get you killed. Or worse<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s gonna make you kill
someone who doesn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
deserve it.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo didn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
 listen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was fifteen, fully grown into his beauty, his power, his
arrogance. The Wave Style was mastered. The Wind Style<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>dangerous, self-destructive, brilliant<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>was developing. He had
begun sketching the first equations for Gravity Manipulation, though he wouldn<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t complete it for years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was unstoppable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he was miserable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part III: The Dark Girl Who Didn<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t Care</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui was seventeen when she decided she wanted Nanzo Anitsu
.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not because he was beautiful<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>though
he was. Not because he was powerful<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>though
he was. Not because he was the last heir of a legendary clan<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>though he was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She wanted him because he looked at her like she was dirt,
and she knew<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>knew with
the certainty of Killer B<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s
training and her own stubborn heart<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that
he was lying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Ugly
dark girl,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> he called
her, the first time they sparred. Academy demonstration, advanced students
only. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Don<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t touch me with your sweaty
hands.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Prince,<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> she shot back, grinning,
not offended at all. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>You
hit like a dying butterfly.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He hated her immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hated that she wasn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
intimidated. Hated that she laughed at his insults. Hated that she was dark<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>beautifully, defiantly
dark, with amber eyes that caught the light like honey<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and that she clearly thought his white skin
was weird, not wonderful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>You<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>re disgusting,<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> he told her after she
blocked his Wave Style pulse with sheer physical speed. <span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Dark and ugly and common.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>And
you<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>re soft,<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> she replied, bouncing on
her toes. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>All that
pretty white skin and no real combat training. What happens when I get close, Prince?<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He panicked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She saw it<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
micro-expression, the flicker of yellow eyes toward his feet, the unconscious
step backward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He has no close combat ability, she realized. All that
power, all that range, and he<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s
helpless up close.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
exploit it then. She was seventeen, he was fifteen, and despite his arrogance,
there was something broken in his eyes that made her hesitate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she watched him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Watched the other girls fawn over his beauty while he
sneered at them. Watched the boys mock his <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Prince<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> behavior while he
pretended not to hear. Watched the white minority gossip about how unlucky he
was, how tragic, how wasted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And she watched Nora<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>eighteen
now, technically his maid, functionally his mother<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>hovering with desperate protectiveness,
killing anyone who got too close with polite words and cold eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>He
needs someone to break him,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span>
Karui told Omoi one night, drinking cheap sake in their shared apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>He
needs therapy,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> Omoi
said, ever practical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Same
thing.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>At forest near the cloud village l</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hidden Cloud Village stood silent beneath a bruised
purple sky, but in the ancient training grounds northwest of the village gates<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>where the trees grew so
thick that sunlight barely touched the moss-covered earth<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>two storms were about to
collide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui of Kumogakure, age 17, Ch<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>nin, kenjutsu specialist under Killer B
himself, adjusted her forehead protector and tightened her grip on the long
katana strapped to her back. Her amber eyes scanned the clearing with the
practiced intensity of someone who'd grown up in a village where dark was the
standard<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>where the
Raikage himself shared her rich skin tone, where Killer B's darkness was
legendary, where 70% of the population looked like her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She wasn't supposed to be here. None of the girls were. Not
when he was training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Karui had never been good at following rules that didn't
make sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo Anitsu, age 18, head of the nearly-extinct Anitsu Clan,
moved through his kata with the kind of beauty that made people forget to
breathe. White skin that seemed to glow in the forest dimness. Black wolf hair<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>wild, untamed, framing a
face of almost painful elegance. And those eyes...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yellow. Pure yellow. No whites, no pupils, just liquid gold
that marked him as blood descendant of the only Kekkei Genkai clan in Cloud
Village.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rare white-skinned, yellow-eyed minority. The &quot;Prince&quot;
that every girl in the village whispered about. The orphan who'd lost his
parents at ten, raised by his clan's maid Nora, survivor of a clan reduced to
four living members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui watched from the treeline, amber eyes narrowed. She'd
liked him once. From a distance. Like all the others. But Nanzo Anitsu didn<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t  care about dark girls.
He'd never looked twice at any of them<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>too
busy being beautiful, too busy being above the common dark-skinned majority
that made Kumogakure strong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White is ugly, she thought, the mantra she'd developed to
armor her heart against his indifference. Dark is beautiful and sexy. Whites
are disgusting. Except...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except when he moved like that. When the wind itself seemed
to bow to his will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stepped on a branch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo stopped mid-motion. Those golden eyes turned toward
her, and Karui felt her stomach clench<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
from fear, never from fear, but from the weight of being seen by someone who'd
never truly seen her before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're in my training ground,&quot; he said. His voice
was cultured, distant. The voice of someone who'd been raised on grief and
legacy and the weight of a dying clan. &quot;Leave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Make me,&quot; Karui said, stepping into the clearing.
Her hand rested on her sword hilt. &quot;I've watched you, Anitsu. You think
you're untouchable. Beyond-world-level, they say. Stronger than Kage. The last
hope of your precious white bloodline.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's perfect lips curved. Not a smile. A dismissal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're that dark girl,&quot; he said. &quot;The loud
one. Killer B's student.&quot; He tilted his head, studying her like she was an
insect. &quot;Flat-chested, too. Omoi mentioned it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words hit like shuriken. Karui felt heat rise to her
face<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not shame, but
rage. The same rage that had made her beat Naruto Uzumaki savagely when he'd
refused to give up Sasuke. The same rage that made her ESTJ Type 8 soul scream
for dominance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Fight me,&quot; she demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't fight commoners.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Fight me, or I'll tell the village the Anitsu Clan
head is a coward.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something shifted in those golden eyes. The mask cracked<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>just slightly<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>revealing the wounded boy
beneath, the orphan who'd had to become a god to survive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very well,&quot; Nanzo said softly. &quot;But
understand<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>this is not
a spar. This is a lesson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It began with wind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo didn't move. He simply raised his hand, and the air
between them screamed. Karui threw herself sideways as a invisible blade carved
through the space she'd occupied, shredding bark from a century-old oak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind Style: Massive Destroyer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Long range only,&quot; she gasped, rolling to her feet.
Killer B's training had taught her to analyze fast, to find patterns in chaos.
&quot;You can't use that close-range without killing yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's smile widened. &quot;Clever. But irrelevant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He raised both hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gravity Manipulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt it instantly<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
crushing weight that slammed her to her knees, then flat against the earth. Her
bones creaked. Her lungs seized. Every cell in her body screamed for relief as
the artificial gravity he'd created<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>founded
on his academy expertise in physics, refined through years of solitary study<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>pinned her like a specimen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Five-meter dead zone,&quot; she choked out,
understanding even as her vision blurred. &quot;You can't... affect anything...
within five meters...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;True.&quot; Nanzo walked slowly toward her, stopping
just outside that invisible boundary. Six meters away. Safe. Untouchable.
&quot;But you can't reach me, can you? Dark girl. Stubborn girl. Ugly
girl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He circled her, golden eyes cold with something that wasn't
quite cruelty<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>was it
loneliness? Desperation to prove his superiority to someone, anyone, after
losing everything?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ugly weak darky,&quot; he murmured, and the words cut
deeper than any blade. &quot;That's what you are. What you'll always be. The
dark majority<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>common,
unremarkable, beneath notice. I'm the last of a bloodline that descends from
gods. You? You're one of thousands. Dark like the dirt. Dark like<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Shut up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui tried to rise. Failed. The gravity was absolute<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>no chakra could move, no
muscle could contract against the force he'd calculated so precisely. She felt
something tear in her shoulder, felt blood fill her mouth from where she'd
bitten her tongue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then the waves came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wave Style.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not through the air<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>through
her. Vibrations that bypassed skin and muscle and struck directly at organs.
Her lungs liquefied slightly with each pulse. Her heart stuttered. Neural
pathways shattered and reformed wrong, sending signals of agony that had no
source, no cure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Death pain. Without external wound. Without warning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your tenketsu are collapsing,&quot; Nanzo informed
her, still circling, still six meters away. &quot;In fifteen minutes, your
chakra network will be permanently destroyed. You'll die as a civilian. A
failure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was playing with her. She realized it through the haze of
suffering<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he could
kill her instantly with a precise brain wave disruption, but he was drawing it
out. Taunting her. Trying to break her spirit with humiliation because...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because he's never been touched. Never been truly
challenged. The white minority Prince, surrounded by dark excellence he can't
understand, clinging to his rarity as superiority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Give up,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Admit you're
ugly. Admit you're weak. Admit you're dark<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and
that darkness will always be second to light. Say it, and I'll release
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui's amber eyes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>amber,
not his pure yellow, beautiful in their humanity<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>met
his golden gaze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And she smiled. Bloody. Fierce. Stubborn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She began to study him. Even as her organs screamed. Even as
the gravity held her pinned like a butterfly to a board. Killer B's training:
When you can't move, use your mind. When you can't fight, find the weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Five-meter dead zone. He stayed at six meters<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>just outside it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind Style: long and mid-range only. Vortex would absorb him
at close range. Massive Destroyer would kill him too. Air Absorption had no
effect within five meters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wave Style: on cooldown after use. Fifteen minutes between
applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gravity Manipulation: one minute duration... then
thirty-minute cooldown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He'd been talking for forty-five seconds. Showing off.
Playing the beautiful, cruel prince.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifteen seconds left on the gravity lock. Wave Style already
used and cooling. Wind Style unusable at close range. No taijutsu skill<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he's never needed it. No
kenjutsu<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>relies
entirely on jutsu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the gravity releases... he'll have nothing. Nothing for
thirty minutes. Nothing for fifteen minutes. Just his white skin and his pretty
face and his emptiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're going to die,&quot; Nanzo said, but there was
something uncertain in his voice now. She wasn't breaking. Wasn't crying.
Wasn't begging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Three,&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Two.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He stepped back. Instinctive. Afraid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;One.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The gravity vanished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui didn't hesitate. Didn't think. Exploded upward using
the flash-speed movement Killer B had beaten into her through years of brutal
training<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>closing six
meters in less than a heartbeat, ignoring the death pain still ravaging her
insides from Wave Style damage, ignoring the blood pouring from her nose and
ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's golden eyes went wide. He tried to raise his hand<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wave Style on cooldown. Fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He tried to push<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gravity on cooldown. Thirty minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He tried to summon wind<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Would kill them both at this range. Suicide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the first time in his life, Nanzo Anitsu was helpless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui didn't use her sword. Too impersonal. Too clean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She bit him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her teeth sank into the left side of his neck with all the
fury of a girl who'd been called ugly dark one too many times, who'd watched
the white minority clutch their pearls while surrounded by dark excellence,
who'd been rejected by a boy too beautiful to see her strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She bit until she tasted blood. Until her jaw ached. Until
she felt the cartilage of his neck give slightly beneath her determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And she held on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo made a sound<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>half
scream, half something else, something broken and vulnerable that he'd never
let anyone hear. His hands came up to push her away, but he had no strength<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>never trained for this,
never imagined being touched, being marked, being claimed by someone he'd
dismissed as beneath him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They fell together. Karui on top. Her teeth still in his
neck. His golden eyes staring up at the canopy, shocked, tears streaming from
the corners because no one had ever<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No one had ever<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You,&quot; she growled against his bloody neck,
finally releasing her bite but keeping him pinned with her weight, her dark
skin against his white, her amber eyes burning into his yellow. &quot;You with
your 'ugly weak darky.' Your 'common.' Your 'beneath.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She grabbed his chin, forced him to look at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I am Karui of Kumogakure. I am dark like the Raikage.
Dark like Killer B. Dark like 70% of this village that you think you're above.
And I just defeated you<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
with jutsu, not with bloodline, but with teeth and will and the stubbornness
you mocked.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo stared at her. Bleeding. Marked. Hers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His lips moved. No sound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I claimed you,&quot; she whispered, fierce and
possessive. &quot;This bite<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;
she touched the wound she'd left, already swelling, already permanent &quot;<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>this is mine. You are mine.
The white minority can gossip about their 'Prince' being stolen by the 'ugly
dark girl.' Let them. I am the majority. I am the standard. I am what this
village looks like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She leaned down, her dark lips close to his pale ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you? You're beautiful, Nanzo Anitsu. I'll give you
that. But you're weak without your jutsu. Helpless. A Prince who needed a dark
girl to teach him what real strength looks like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stood. Her body screamed from Wave Style damage<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she'd need medical
attention, would carry internal scars forever<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but
she stood tall. Dark. Proud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thirty minutes,&quot; she said, looking down at him
still sprawled on the moss, hand pressed to his bleeding neck. &quot;That's how
long your gravity is on cooldown. Fifteen for Wave Style. I'm going to walk
away now. When you can move again, come find me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui.&quot; His voice<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>broken,
raw, changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those golden eyes, which had been so cold, now held
something like... wonder? Terror? Recognition?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You... you didn't kill me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't kill helpless opponents,&quot; she said.
&quot;Even pretty white ones who call me ugly.&quot; She smiled, fierce and
loving even then, even before the love was real. &quot;Besides. I want you to
remember this. Remember how a dark girl from the majority made you helpless.
Remember my teeth in your neck every time you look in the mirror.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She walked into the trees. Didn't look back. Didn't see him
touch the wound with trembling fingers, didn't see him realize that for the
first time since his parents died, since Nora raised him alone, since he became
a god to survive<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he'd
been seen. Truly seen. Darkness and all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aftermath:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bite scar never faded. Nanzo wore it on the left side of
his neck, a permanent crescent of teeth marks that he touched when he needed to
remember.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 2: The Return</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The secure quarters were located in the southern quadrant of
the village, a series of rooms reserved for high-value debriefings and
protective custody. Karui had been in them before<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>after
the Five Kage Summit, when she had beaten Naruto Uzumaki bloody for information
about Sasuke Uchiha, when her temper had made her a liability that needed
containment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She hated these rooms. The walls were too thick, the windows
too small, the air too still. They reminded her of being trapped, of gravity
holding her in place while a voice mocked her from beyond reach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Will you stop pacing?&quot; Omoi asked from his
position against the far wall. &quot;You're making me nervous, and when I get
nervous, I start thinking about worst-case scenarios, like what if this is
actually a trap and we're being held here because someone discovered that time
I accidentally<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Omoi.&quot; Samui's voice cut through his anxiety
spiral with surgical precision. &quot;Silence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui shot her teammate a grateful look. Samui sat at the
small table, her blonde hair catching the overhead light, her expression
composed as she reviewed the mission report for the third time. They had
returned from the northern patrol to find an escort waiting, orders to
surrender their equipment, and instructions to wait in isolation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something was wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Three hours,&quot; Karui said, not stopping her
pacing. &quot;We've been here three hours. No debrief, no explanation, just<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>wait. This isn't standard
procedure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's political,&quot; Samui said without looking up.
&quot;The way they separated us from our gear, the specific location of these
quarters<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>this is
protective custody, not detention.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Protective custody implies a threat.&quot; Omoi's hand
drifted to where his sword would normally rest. &quot;Who's threatening
us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Iwa,&quot; Karui said flatly. She had been thinking
about it since they were intercepted, turning over possibilities in her mind.
&quot;The northern patrol found evidence of Explosion Corps activity near the
border, but no actual engagement. Then we're pulled into isolation immediately
upon return. Darui-sama is preparing for something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Preparing for what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door opened before Karui could answer. She spun, hand
reaching automatically for a sword that wasn't there, and found herself face to
face with the one person she had not expected to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo Anitsu stood in the doorway, his white formal robes
immaculate, his yellow eyes fixed on her with an intensity that made her breath
catch. He looked different than she remembered<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>older,
somehow, though it had only been weeks since their last encounter. The lines
around his eyes were tighter, his posture more rigid. The scar on his neck, her
scar, was hidden by his collar, but she knew it was there. She always knew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui,&quot; he said, and her name in his mouth
sounded like a confession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Prince,&quot; she replied, because old habits died
hard, because she needed the distance that mockery provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something flickered in his expression<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>pain, perhaps, or memory. Then he stepped into
the room, and she saw that he wasn't alone. Two ANBU flanked him, their masks
featureless, their presence a reminder that this was official business despite
the intimacy of his gaze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Samui-san, Omoi-san,&quot; Nanzo said, his voice
shifting to formal politeness. &quot;The Raikage requests your presence in the
tactical chamber. Your debrief will be conducted by Darui-sama
personally.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samui rose smoothly, gathering her reports. Omoi hesitated,
looking between Karui and Nanzo with the sharp eyes of someone who missed
nothing. &quot;And Karui?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Remains here.&quot; Nanzo's tone brooked no argument.
&quot;I need to speak with her. Alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ANBU didn't move. Karui felt her temper rising, that familiar
heat that had always been her weakness and her strength. &quot;Alone? With the
clan head? That seems improper, doesn't it? A dark girl from the majority alone
with the precious white prize of Kumogakure?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui.&quot; Nanzo's voice dropped, becoming something
private, something that existed only between them. &quot;Please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had never heard him say please before. Not when she had
defeated him, not when she had marked him, not in all the complicated months of
their association. It stopped her anger more effectively than any command could
have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samui touched her shoulder as she passed<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a brief pressure, comrade
to comrade. Omoi's look was more complicated, worry and curiosity and something
like warning. Then they were gone, the door sealing behind them, and Karui was
alone with the man she had bitten, the man she had trained, the man she refused
to call by name because names meant attachment and attachment meant
vulnerability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You look terrible,&quot; she said, because kindness
had never been her language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; he replied, and the
simplicity of it shattered something in her chest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't.&quot; She turned away, moving to the window,
putting physical distance between them. &quot;Don't say things like that. Not
here, not now. You called me here for a reason, Anitsu-sama. Political,
according to Samui. So be political.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She heard him move, the whisper of silk against stone, and
then he was behind her. Not touching<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he
never touched her without permission, not since the forest<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but close enough that she
could feel his presence like warmth against her back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Iwa has targeted you,&quot; he said, his voice low.
&quot;They see you as a way to get to me. Or as a threat to be eliminated to
destabilize my position.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because I defeated you.&quot; It wasn't a question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because you defeated me. Because the village sees us
as... connected.&quot; He paused, and she heard him swallow. &quot;Because I
cannot stop looking at you, and everyone knows it, and that makes you valuable
to my enemies and dangerous to my allies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui turned to face him. He was closer than she expected,
close enough to see the gold flecks in his yellow eyes, the faint shadow of
exhaustion beneath them. Close enough to hurt him, if she wanted. Close enough
to be hurt, if he chose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your allies,&quot; she repeated. &quot;The white
minority. The ones who call me the ugly dark stubborn girl who stole their Prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Some of them, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And your mother? Nora-san?&quot; She watched his face
carefully, saw the micro-expression of pain that he couldn't quite hide.
&quot;Does she think I'm a threat too?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's hand rose, stopping just short of touching her
cheek. She could feel the chakra in his fingers, the controlled vibration of
Wave Style held in check. &quot;Nora loves me,&quot; he said carefully.
&quot;She wants what's best for me. She just... disagrees about what that
is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She thinks I'm ugly.&quot; Karui said it flatly,
without self-pity. It was a fact, one she had known since she first entered the
Anitsu compound  and felt Nora's yellow eyes assess her dark skin with polite
revulsion. &quot;She thinks I'm too dark, too loud, too stubborn. She thinks
I'll pollute your precious bloodline.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She doesn't know you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She doesn't want to know me.&quot; Karui stepped back,
breaking the almost-contact between them. &quot;None of them do. The white
minority, the thirty percent who think they're better than the seventy percent
of us who actually make this village run. They look at me and see a threat to
their rarity, their specialness. They look at you and see something that
belongs to them, that should stay pure and white and locked away in their
little compound.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was breathing hard, her temper fully engaged now, the
words pouring out of her like water breaking through a dam. &quot;You know what
I see when I look at them? Weakness. That pale, bloodless skin like they haven't
seen the sun in years. Those yellow eyes that look at me like I'm dirt. I see
people who are scared because they're surrounded by darkness<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>our darkness, the darkness
of the Raikage and Killer B and Darui and me and everyone else who actually has
color in our skin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't.&quot; She held up her hand, stopping him.
&quot;Don't defend them. Don't make excuses. I've heard it all before. 'They
mean well.' 'They're just traditional.' 'They don't understand.' I don't care.
I don't need their understanding. I need them to leave me alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice
was different<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>softer,
more vulnerable, the voice he used in private moments that she wasn't supposed
to know about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What do you need from me?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question stopped her. She had expected argument,
defense, the polished manners of the clan head protecting his own. Instead, he
was looking at her with something like desperation, as if her answer mattered
more than his next breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I need...&quot; She stopped, swallowed, forced herself
to be honest in a way that terrified her. &quot;I need you to stop being the Prince.
Just for a moment. Just here. I need you to be Nanzo, the boy who lost his
parents at ten, who was raised by a woman who loves him but doesn't understand
him. I need you to be the person I bit in that forest, the person who was
helpless and human and real.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He closed his eyes. When he opened them, something had
changed<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the mask had
slipped, revealing the man beneath. &quot;I am always helpless with you,&quot;
he said quietly. &quot;From the first moment you looked at me and saw through
the gravity locks and the Wave Style and the clan head title. You saw the
five-meter dead zone. You saw the cooldown periods. You saw me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And I bit you.&quot; Karui's hand rose to her own
neck, touching the place where she wished she had a mark to match his. &quot;I
claimed you when you couldn't fight back. That wasn't fair.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It was honest.&quot; He smiled, small and sad.
&quot;Everything with you is honest. Even when you're shouting, even when
you're angry, even when you're calling me Prince with that tone that makes me
want to prove you wrong. You're the only person in this village who doesn't
want something from the Anitsu Clan head. You just want... me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I want you to be safe.&quot; The admission escaped
before she could stop it. &quot;I want you to stop carrying the weight of a
dead clan on your shoulders. I want you to sleep without dreaming of waves that
destroy everything you love.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He reached out then, finally, and took her hand. His fingers
were cold, trembling slightly, but his grip was firm. &quot;Stay here
tonight,&quot; he said. &quot;In the compound. I can arrange it<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>guest quarters, proper
security. If Iwa is targeting you, you're safer with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;With you,&quot; she repeated. &quot;In the Anitsu
compound . Where your mother will serve me tea with her polite smile and her
internal screaming about the dark girl touching her precious boy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She will behave,&quot; Nanzo said, and there was steel
in his voice now<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
clan head emerging, protective and commanding. &quot;Or she will leave. You are
my guest, Karui. My honored guest. Anyone who disrespects you disrespects
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui looked at their joined hands<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his pale fingers intertwined with her dark
ones, the contrast stark and undeniable. She thought of Nora's internal
revulsion, of the white minority's gossip, of the seventy percent of the
village that looked like her and accepted her as normal. She thought of the
bite mark on his neck and the way he had looked at her just now, as if she were
the only real thing in a world of ghosts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Fine,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll stay. But I'm not
sleeping in guest quarters, Prince. If you're protecting me, you do it
properly. I want a room with a window that opens, and I want my sword back, and
I want you to stop calling me honored guest like I'm some diplomat from
Kiri.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What do you want me to call you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She squeezed his hand, letting her nails bite just enough to
remind him of her teeth. &quot;Call me Karui. Just Karui. The stubborn girl who
defeated you and isn't sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He laughed, surprised, the sound young and genuine in a way
that made her heart ache. &quot;Karui,&quot; he said, testing it. &quot;Just
Karui.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Better.&quot; She released his hand, stepping back,
putting her armor back in place. &quot;Now, tell me about this Iwa threat. If
someone's trying to kill me, I want to know everything. And then I want to know
how we're going to make them regret it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mask slipped back over his features, but not completely.
Something remained in his eyes, something warm and alive that hadn't been there
when he entered. &quot;Come,&quot; he said, moving toward the door. &quot;I'll
show you what we've recovered. And Karui?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you.&quot; He paused at the door, looking back
at her with an expression she couldn't quite read. &quot;For seeing me. Even
when I don't deserve to be seen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She followed him out into the corridor, her hand resting on
the hilt of the sword that the ANBU reluctantly returned, and thought that this
was how it started. Not with romance or gentleness, but with honesty and teeth
marks and the stubborn refusal to look away from each other's damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was how love began in Kumogakure, in the space between
a Prince and a girl who refused to be anything less than exactly what she was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 3: The Compound</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Anitsu Clan compound occupied the northeastern ridge of
Kumogakure, a series of white stone buildings that seemed to grow from the
mountain itself. Karui had been here before<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>once,
briefly, after the forest battle when Nanzo had been recovering from her bite
and she had been summoned to explain herself to the clan elders. She remembered
feeling like a shadow in a snowfield, her dark skin conspicuous against the
pale architecture, her loud voice echoing too loudly in the hushed corridors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, walking beside Nanzo as the sun began to set, she felt
that same dissonance but refused to show it. Let them stare. Let Nora Anitsulook
down from whatever window she occupied and see her precious boy walking with
the dark girl from the majority. Let the white minority whisper about
contamination and impurity. Karui was here by invitation of the clan head
himself, and she would not be ashamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The main residence is this way,&quot; Nanzo said,
gesturing toward the largest building, a three-story structure with curved
roofs that mimicked the shape of waves. &quot;Your quarters will be in the
eastern wing. They overlook the training grounds<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>you'll
have space to practice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't need special treatment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You need to be safe.&quot; He stopped at the entrance,
turning to face her with an expression that was half apology, half
stubbornness. &quot;I know you can protect yourself, Karui. I've experienced
your capabilities firsthand. But Iwa's weapon is something different. It
targets chakra networks through resonance<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>if
they catch you unaware, you won't have time to draw your sword.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you can protect me from this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can try.&quot; He reached for the door, then
hesitated. &quot;My mother will be waiting inside. She... she doesn't know
you're coming. I thought it better to surprise her than to give her time to
prepare objections.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt her temper flare, hot and familiar. &quot;You
didn't tell her? Nanzo, I'm not some secret to be hidden<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're not a secret.&quot; He turned back to her, and
she saw something desperate in his eyes. &quot;You're the most important person
in my life, and I don't know how to explain that to her. I don't know how to
explain that you defeated me, that you trained me, that you see me when no one
else does. So yes, I didn't tell her. Because I was afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The admission shocked her into silence. Nanzo Anitsu, who
controlled gravity and waves and could kill with a thought, afraid of his
mother's reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Of what?&quot; she asked quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That she would say the things you're afraid of
hearing. That she would look at you with disgust, call you ugly, say you don't
belong. And that I would...&quot; He stopped, swallowed. &quot;That I would
fail to defend you properly. That I would fall back into being the clan head,
the perfect son, and let her hurt you because it's easier than fighting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui stared at him. In all their complicated history, she
had never heard him speak like this<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>raw,
uncertain, admitting weakness before they even entered the battlefield. It made
her want to fight for him, to stand between him and everything that wanted to
break him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then we'll go in together,&quot; she said, moving to
stand beside him. &quot;And if she says those things, I'll defend myself. I
don't need you to fight my battles, Prince. I need you to stand with me while I
fight them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at her for a long moment, something like wonder in
his expression. Then he nodded, once, and opened the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The entrance hall was exactly as Karui remembered<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>white marble floors, walls
painted with murals of ocean waves, the air cool and smelling of incense and
old secrets. Nora Anitsu stood at the far end, arranging flowers in a tall
vase, her white kimono pristine, her yellow eyes downcast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom,&quot; Nanzo said, and Karui heard the slight
tremor in his voice. &quot;We have a guest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora turned. Her face was composed, beautiful in the way of porcelain
dolls, but Karui saw the moment of recognition, the slight widening of eyes,
the almost imperceptible tightening of her jaw. In that instant, she knew
everything<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>knew that
Nora had hoped her son would come home alone, that the rumors of his involvement
with the dark girl were exaggerated, that purity could still be preserved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui-san,&quot; Nora said, her voice perfectly
polite, perfectly cold. &quot;What an unexpected pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nora-san.&quot; Karui bowed slightly, maintaining eye
contact. &quot;Thank you for having me. Your son insisted on my safety.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Did he?&quot; Nora's gaze flicked to Nanzo, and Karui
saw the question in her eyes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>why,
why her, why this dark stubborn girl who stands out like a wound in our white
world? &quot;The eastern wing, I assume? I'll prepare the guest quarters
immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom.&quot; Nanzo's voice was firm now, the clan head
asserting himself. &quot;Karui will dine with us tonight. In the family
quarters. She is not a guest to be hidden away<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she
is here as my...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He paused, searching for words. Karui watched Nora's face,
saw the hope that he would say colleague, or friend, or even opponent<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>anything that maintained
distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My trusted ally,&quot; Nanzo finished. &quot;And my
teacher. She has agreed to continue my training in close combat. To address the
weaknesses you yourself have noted in my defensive capabilities.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was cleverly done, Karui had to admit. Framing her
presence as practical, beneficial, aligned with Nora's own concerns for his
safety. She saw Nora hesitate, the calculations running behind her yellow eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Of course,&quot; Nora said finally, her smile not
reaching her eyes. &quot;We must discuss the menu, then. Karui-san, do you have
any dietary restrictions? Any... preferences?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pause before preferences was barely perceptible, but
Karui heard it. Any preferences, as if her dark palate might be different,
might require special consideration, might be somehow less refined than theirs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I eat what Nanzo eats,&quot; she said, deliberately
using his name without honorific, watching Nora's composure crack slightly.
&quot;We've shared meals before. He knows my tastes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The implication hung in the air<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>shared meals, shared space, shared intimacy
that went beyond formal politeness. Nora's hands tightened on the flower she
held, crushing a petal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then I'll prepare his favorites,&quot; she said, her
voice slightly strained. &quot;Nanzo, perhaps you could show Karui-san to her
quarters? I'll call you when dinner is ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned back to her flowers, dismissing them, and Karui
felt Nanzo's hand on her elbow, guiding her toward the eastern corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That went well,&quot; she murmured as they moved out
of earshot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's trying,&quot; Nanzo replied, but he didn't sound
convinced. &quot;In her way, she's trying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's trying to accept that I'm here without accepting
that I belong here.&quot; Karui stopped at the door to her assigned room,
turning to face him. &quot;It's fine, Nanzo. I don't need her to love me. I
just need her not to sabotage us while we deal with this Iwa threat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Us.&quot; He caught the word, held it like a precious
thing. &quot;You said us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We're allies, aren't we? You said so yourself.&quot;
She opened the door, revealing a room that was spacious but sterile<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>white walls, white bedding,
a single window that did indeed overlook the training grounds. &quot;Even if I
think 'trusted ally' is a coward's way of describing what we are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What are we, then?&quot; He followed her into the
room, closing the door behind them, and suddenly the space felt smaller, more
intimate. &quot;Tell me, Karui. Since you're so brave with words.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She dropped her pack on the bed, turning to face him. The
setting sun painted the room in gold and rose, making his white skin glow,
casting her own dark complexion in shadows that she knew he found beautiful. She
had seen it in his eyes, that particular hunger that had nothing to do with
chakra or combat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We're complicated,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm the girl
who defeated you when you were helpless. You're the boy who let me. We're bound
by teeth marks and training sessions and the fact that neither of us knows how
to be vulnerable with anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That sounds like damage,&quot; he said quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It sounds like honesty.&quot; She stepped closer,
close enough to touch, close enough to hurt. &quot;The question is, Prince,
what do you want us to be? Beyond allies, beyond teacher and student. What do
you want when the doors are closed and no one's watching?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She watched his throat work as he swallowed, watched his
hand rise to touch the collar that hid her mark. &quot;I want...&quot; He
stopped, started again. &quot;I want to sleep without dreaming of losing
everyone I love. I want to stop being the last of my line, the precious white
prize that everyone wants to possess. I want to be someone who deserves to be
seen, not because of my bloodline, but because of who I choose to be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And who do you choose to be?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His hand dropped from his collar, reaching out to touch her
face<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>tentatively, as
if expecting her to pull away. When she didn't, when she leaned into his palm,
she felt him shudder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I choose to be the man who learns from you,&quot; he
said. &quot;Who grows stronger because you pushed him to grow. Who maybe,
someday, could be worthy of...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn't finish the sentence. Outside, a bell rang<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nora calling them to
dinner, the sound sharp and intrusive. Nanzo stepped back, the moment broken,
his mask sliding back into place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Dinner,&quot; he said, his voice slightly rough.
&quot;We should go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui let him lead her out, but she touched her cheek where
his hand had been, memorizing the feeling. Worthy of what, she wondered. Worthy
of her? Of love? Of a life that wasn't defined by clan duty and extinct
bloodlines?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She would find out, she decided. However long it took,
however many dinners with Nora's cold politeness and the white minority's
gossip, she would find out what Nanzo Anitsu could  become when he stopped
being a Prince and started being a man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dinner was a study in controlled tension. The family
quarters were smaller than the main hall, more intimate, which made Nora's
presence feel larger, more oppressive. She served them with mechanical
precision, her movements graceful and empty, her conversation limited to
inquiries about Nanzo's day that carefully excluded Karui.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Raikage's summit,&quot; Nora said, pouring tea for
her son<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>only for her
son, Karui noticed. &quot;Did Darui-sama have specific concerns?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Border security,&quot; Nanzo replied, his eyes
flicking to Karui. &quot;Intelligence suggests Iwa has developed new
capabilities. We're analyzing the evidence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Iwa.&quot; Nora's lips thinned. &quot;Your father died
fighting Iwa, you know. During the Second War. Explosion Corps.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know, Mom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Such a waste.&quot; Nora set down the teapot, her
hands lingering on the ceramic. &quot;All that potential, all that bloodline
purity, destroyed by crude explosives. If he had survived, if the clan had
maintained its numbers...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn't finish, but Karui heard the implication. If the
clan had maintained its numbers, Nanzo wouldn't need to associate with
outsiders. Wouldn't need to bring dark girls into their sacred spaces. Wouldn't
need to dilute what remained of their precious heritage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The clan will survive,&quot; Nanzo said quietly.
&quot;In whatever form it needs to take.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora's eyes met Karui's across the table, and for a moment,
the polite mask slipped. Karui saw it then<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
full force of Nora's internal revulsion, the screaming thoughts that Nanzo
would never hear. Ugly dark. Dark lips. Body that might scare him. Stubborn and
loud. Pollution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. &quot;The food is
delicious, Nora-san,&quot; she said, her voice deliberately loud, deliberately
present. &quot;You have excellent skills. Nanzo is fortunate to have been
raised by someone so capable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words were innocent, but the delivery was a challenge. I
am here. I am loud. I am dark. And your son brought me here, wants me here,
sees something in me that you never will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nora said, her voice tight. &quot;I
learned from my mother, who learned from hers. Our traditions go back
generations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Traditions change,&quot; Karui replied, taking a bite
of fish, chewing slowly, maintaining eye contact. &quot;Especially when
survival requires it. The Cloud Village itself is proof of that<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>we've adapted, grown,
incorporated new techniques and new people. That's why we're strong.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Strength without purity is merely chaos.&quot; Nora's
hand trembled slightly as she reached for her own cup. &quot;The Anitsu Clan
has endured because we maintained our standards. Our bloodline is... special.
Unique. It would be tragic to lose that uniqueness through...
carelessness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom.&quot; Nanzo's voice was sharp, warning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm simply making conversation,&quot; Nora said, her
innocence as false as her smile. &quot;Karui-san understands, don't you? The
importance of preserving what makes us who we are?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui set down her chopsticks. She thought of Kumogakure's
seventy percent, of the Raikage and Killer B and all the dark-skinned shinobi
who had built this village with their sweat and blood. She thought of Nora's
fear, small and pathetic, the terror of a minority surrounded by a majority
they couldn't control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I understand that survival requires adaptation,&quot;
she said, her voice steady. &quot;The strongest species aren't the ones who
refuse to change<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>they're
the ones who change best. Your clan has survived wars, assassinations,
near-extinction. That suggests resilience, not rigidity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Resilience has limits.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Everything has limits.&quot; Karui leaned forward, her
amber eyes catching the lamplight. &quot;The question is whether you recognize
when you've reached them. When holding on to the past becomes more dangerous
than embracing the future.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The silence stretched between them, electric and dangerous. Nanzo
sat frozen, caught between the woman who raised him and the woman who saw him,
and Karui felt a moment's pity for him<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>trapped
in this white room between two kinds of love, two kinds of truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Nora said finally, her voice barely
above a whisper, &quot;we should discuss more pleasant topics. Nanzo, tell me
about your training. You mentioned close combat?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the meal passed in safe superficialities, but
Karui had made her point. She was here. She wasn't going anywhere. And Nora Anitsuwould
have to learn to live with the darkness in her white world, or be consumed by
her own fear of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later, in the silence of her assigned room, Karui stood at
the window and watched the compound's training grounds below. The moon had
risen, casting everything in silver and shadow, and she could see movement
there<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a solitary
figure practicing forms with a precision that spoke of desperation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She recognized his style now, the way he moved. The
long-range power that made him devastating at a distance, the careful footwork
that maintained the five-meter safety zone, the slight hesitation that revealed
his lingering discomfort with physical contact. She had trained that hesitation
out of him, or started to. She had taught him to embrace the closeness that had
once been his weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, watching him move through kata after kata, she saw
something new. Anger, perhaps. Or fear. The Iwa threat, his mother's barely
veiled hostility, the weight of being clan head in a world that wanted to break
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She grabbed her sword and went to join him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn't stop when she approached, didn't acknowledge her
presence, but she saw his movements shift slightly<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>becoming more deliberate, more performative.
Showing off, even now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your stance is wrong,&quot; she said, when he
completed a sequence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Is it?&quot; He lowered his arms, breathing hard.
&quot;I was practicing what you taught me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You were practicing what you think I want to
see.&quot; She circled him, assessing. &quot;You're tense. Your shoulders are
up, your weight is back. You're preparing to retreat before you've even engaged.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm preparing to maintain distance. My
advantage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your advantage is also your prison.&quot; She stopped
in front of him, close enough to strike, close enough to be struck. &quot;In
the forest, you locked me with gravity. You thought you'd won. But you forgot
the cooldowns. You forgot that power without adaptability becomes
helplessness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I haven't forgotten.&quot; His eyes met hers, yellow
against amber, pale against dark. &quot;I think about that day every moment.
Your teeth in my neck. The way you looked at me when I couldn't fight back.
Like I was finally real.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You were helpless.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I was seen.&quot; He reached out, his hand hovering
near her shoulder, asking permission. When she didn't move away, he touched her<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>lightly, reverently.
&quot;You saw Nanzo. Not the clan head, not the last heir, not the precious
white prize. Just me. Weak and human and defeated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you hated me for it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I loved you for it.&quot; The words hung between them,
stark and irretrievable. &quot;I didn't understand that then. I thought I was
angry, humiliated, betrayed by my own techniques. But really, I was in love
with the first person who ever made me feel like I could be something other
than what I was born to be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt her breath catch. In all their time together,
through all the training and the arguments and the complicated silences, he had
never said this so plainly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know it's not what you want to hear.&quot; He
withdrew his hand, stepping back, putting distance between them. &quot;I know
you see me as a student, or a project, or maybe just an opponent who happened
to be useful. But I need you to know that when I asked you to stay tonight, it
wasn't just about Iwa or security or political necessity. It was because I
can't bear to be in this place, surrounded by ghosts and expectations, without
the one person who makes me feel alive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned away, his shoulders tight, his voice dropping to
something broken. &quot;You don't have to say anything. You don't have to feel
anything. Just... know. And if you want to leave tomorrow, if this is too much,
too complicated, too damaged, I'll understand. I'll protect you from Iwa
regardless. But I needed to tell you the truth, just once, while I had the
courage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui stood in the moonlight, listening to him breathe,
feeling the weight of everything he had said. Love. He had said love. Not
alliance, not gratitude, not the dependency of a student for a teacher. Love,
with all its terror and its hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She thought of Nora inside, dreaming of white purity and
yellow-eyed grandchildren. She thought of the village gossip, the white
minority's fear, the seventy percent who looked like her and would accept her
without question. She thought of her own stubborn heart, guarded and defensive,
that had never let anyone close enough to hurt it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then she thought of Nanzo in the forest, helpless and human
and finally real, and how she had marked him not just as victory but as claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're an idiot,&quot; she said, stepping close behind
him. &quot;A romantic, foolish idiot who reads too much into combat outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He stiffened, preparing for rejection. &quot;Karui<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And I'm apparently an idiot too,&quot; she continued,
&quot;because I've been in love with you since you looked at me after I bit
you, and you didn't hate me. Since you asked me to train you instead of
punishing me. Since you started looking at me like I was beautiful instead of
dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned him around, her hands on his shoulders, forcing
him to face her. &quot;So yes, Nanzo. I'll stay. Not because of Iwa or security
or political necessity. Because I want to be here, with you, in this white
compound full of ghosts, making our own future out of the wreckage of the
past.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His eyes were wide, disbelieving, hope warring with fear.
&quot;You love me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I love the man you become when you're not trying to be
perfect. The one who admits he's afraid, who asks for help, who sleeps in my
lap and tells me my smell is his addiction.&quot; She smiled, feeling the truth
of it settle into her bones. &quot;I love you, you ridiculous Prince. Now stop
looking at me like I'm going to disappear and kiss me properly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He did. It was awkward at first<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he was inexperienced, she was impatient, their
noses bumped and their teeth clicked<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but
then his hands found her waist and her fingers tangled in his hair and the
world narrowed to just this: dark and pale, stubborn and scared, two damaged
people choosing each other against all reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they finally broke apart, both breathing hard, Nanzo
rested his forehead against hers. &quot;Nora can't know,&quot; he whispered.
&quot;Not yet. If she suspects, if she thinks I'm serious about you, she'll...
I don't know what she'll do. But it won't be rational.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She already suspects.&quot; Karui traced the line of
his jaw, memorizing the shape of him. &quot;She looks at me and sees everything
she fears. But she doesn't see what I see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And what's that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Possibility.&quot; Karui stepped back, taking his
hand, leading him toward the practice dummies. &quot;Come. Show me what you've
been working on. And tomorrow, we'll start planning how to deal with Iwa
together. As partners.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Partners,&quot; he repeated, tasting the word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Partners,&quot; she confirmed. &quot;In combat, in
life, in everything. If you'll have me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at her<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>really
looked, with the yellow eyes that marked him as Anitsu blood, seeing her dark
skin and her stubborn jaw and her love that didn't know how to be gentle.
&quot;I'll have you,&quot; he said. &quot;In whatever form you'll come. Dark,
stubborn, loud, and perfect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They trained until dawn, and if Nora watched from the
windows, if she saw her son laughing with the dark girl, touching her hand
between forms, looking at her with an expression that had never been directed
at anything in their white world<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she
didn't say a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Karui felt her watching. And she knew that this was only
the beginning of the war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 4: The Cipher of Waves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three days later, Nanzo stood in the Anitsu Clan's
underground laboratory, surrounded by equipment that had belonged to his
father, his grandfather, generations of Wave Style masters who had died to keep
their secrets safe. The metal fragment from Iwa sat on the central table, still
vibrating with that disturbing resonance, still whispering of secrets that
shouldn't exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well?&quot; Karui asked from the doorway. She had
refused to stay in the compound while he worked, insisting on being present for
any breakthrough. &quot;Have you cracked it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Partially.&quot; He didn't look up from his notes, his
hand moving in precise calculations that she recognized from his academy days<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>physics, he had told her
once, was the foundation of everything he did. Chakra was energy, energy
followed laws, and understanding those laws made him dangerous in ways that
brute force never could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The frequency matches our Wave Style,&quot; he
continued, &quot;but it's crude. Artificial. They've found a way to simulate
the harmonic signature without the actual bloodline. It's like... a recording
of a song, played through bad speakers. Recognizable, but distorted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Can they use it against us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Against me, specifically.&quot; He finally looked up,
his eyes shadowed with exhaustion. &quot;The resonance is tuned to my chakra
signature. They must have obtained a sample<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>blood,
hair, something from the Second War, maybe. If they deploy this in combat, it
could disrupt my Wave Style, cause feedback loops, potentially kill me from
internal resonance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt cold fear settle in her stomach. &quot;Then we
need to change your signature. Or develop a counter-frequency.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've already started.&quot; He gestured to a complex
array of seals on the far wall, glowing with contained energy. &quot;I'm
adapting our clan's sealing techniques. If I can create a wave-cancelling
field, similar to noise-reduction in acoustics...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're going to seal your own chakra?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Temporarily. Just enough to shift my harmonic
signature outside their targeting range.&quot; He moved to the seal array, his
fingers tracing the patterns with absent familiarity. &quot;It's risky. If I
miscalculate, I could seal my Wave Style permanently. Or worse, create a
resonance cascade that destroys the compound.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then don't do it alone.&quot; Karui crossed to stand
beside him, studying the seals that meant nothing to her but everything to him.
&quot;You said we're partners. Partners don't let each other take stupid risks.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This isn't stupid. It's necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's stupid if you die trying.&quot; She caught his
hand, stopping his tracing. &quot;Let me help. I don't understand the wave
mechanics, but I understand combat risk. I can monitor your vitals, watch for
signs of distress. I can pull you out if something goes wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at their joined hands, her dark fingers wrapped
around his pale ones, and she saw him waver. &quot;If something goes wrong, you
could be hurt. The resonance doesn't discriminate<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it
will affect anyone in range.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then I'll stay at the edge of the range. Five meters,
right? Your dead zone.&quot; She squeezed his hand. &quot;Let me be your
safety, Nanzo. Let me do this for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words echoed between them, loaded with memory. In the
forest, he had been helpless in his dead zone, unable to use his powers,
vulnerable to her attack. Now she was offering to enter that space
deliberately, to be his vulnerability and his protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're sure?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've never been more sure of anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He nodded, once, and began to explain the procedure. The
seals would activate in sequence, creating a harmonic field that would interact
with his chakra network. She would monitor his heart rate, his breathing, the
color of his skin<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>any
sign that the resonance was overwhelming his system. If she saw danger, she
would break the central seal, aborting the process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Whatever happens,&quot; he said, as he positioned
himself in the seal array's center, &quot;don't enter the field. If I lose
control, the waves could liquefy your internal organs before you realized you
were in danger.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Promises, promises,&quot; she muttered, but her voice
was tight with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He smiled, that rare genuine smile that transformed his face
from clan head to human being. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said, simply, as if it
were a weapon or a shield or a prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I love you too,&quot; she replied. &quot;Now stop
stalling and do the thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The seals activated with a sound like breaking glass, high
and sharp and wrong. Nanzo's body went rigid, his yellow eyes widening, his
hands clenching into fists. Karui watched from her position at the five-meter
mark, her eyes tracking every detail<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his
breathing, too fast; his skin, too pale; the veins standing out on his neck as
his chakra fought against the artificial resonance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Steady,&quot; she called out, though he probably
couldn't hear her. &quot;You're doing fine. Stay with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The metal fragment on the table began to vibrate violently,
responding to the field. Nanzo gasped, a sound of pain that tore at her
resolve, but she held her position. Trust the plan. Trust his calculations.
Trust that love was stronger than physics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then something went wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The seals flared blinding white, and Nanzo screamed<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a raw, broken sound that
she had never heard from him before. The resonance was overwhelming him,
feeding back on itself, creating a loop that grew stronger with each passing
second. She saw blood begin to trickle from his nose, his ears, the corners of
his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo!&quot; She took a step forward, then forced
herself back. Five meters. The dead zone. If she entered, she would die, and he
would be alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if she didn't enter, he would die anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She made her choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui sprinted forward, crossing the five-meter mark,
feeling the wave pressure hit her like a physical blow. Her ears rang, her
vision blurred, but she kept moving, reaching Nanzo, grabbing his shoulders,
shaking him with all her strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Break the seal!&quot; she shouted, her voice barely
audible over the harmonic scream. &quot;Nanzo, break the central seal!
Now!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His eyes focused on her, bloodshot and terrified.
&quot;Karui... you shouldn't...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Break it, you idiot! That's an order!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His hand moved, sluggish, fighting against the resonance
that wanted to keep him trapped. His fingers found the central seal, the anchor
point of the entire array, and with a final surge of will, he shattered it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The silence that followed was absolute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The seals went dark. The metal fragment stopped vibrating. Nanzo
collapsed against her, his full weight falling into her arms, and she lowered
them both to the ground, checking his pulse, his breathing, the dilation of his
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're okay,&quot; she whispered, more prayer than
statement. &quot;You're okay. I've got you. You're okay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're bleeding,&quot; he murmured, his hand rising to
touch her face. She felt wetness there<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>her
nose, her ears, the same resonance damage she had risked to save him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So are you.&quot; She laughed, slightly hysterical.
&quot;We're a matched set. Damaged and stubborn and alive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He closed his eyes, his head resting against her chest, and
she felt him relax into her hold. &quot;You entered the dead zone,&quot; he
said, wonderingly. &quot;You knew it could kill you, and you entered
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Someone had to save your stupid life.&quot; She
stroked his hair, her hands trembling. &quot;Don't ever scare me like that again,
Nanzo. I mean it. Next time you want to experiment with potentially lethal
chakra resonance, you clear it with me first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; He smiled against her, the
expression tired but genuine. &quot;My stubborn, loud, beautiful
protector.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They stayed like that for a long time, two damaged people in
a basement full of secrets, holding each other together against a world that
wanted to tear them apart. And somewhere above them, Nora Anitsu stood in the
shadows of the corridor, having seen everything, her yellow eyes wide with a
terrible understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had seen her son collapse. She had seen the dark girl
run into danger to save him. She had seen love, raw and undeniable, in the
space where purity was supposed to reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And she didn't know what to do with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 5: The Mission of Broken Things</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The intelligence came three days later, delivered by a
tired-looking Omoi who had clearly run all the way from the Raikage's office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Iwa's agent,&quot; he gasped, leaning against the compound's
doorframe. &quot;We've identified them. Or rather, they've identified
themselves. Left a message at the eastern checkpoint.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo took the proffered scroll, his expression carefully
neutral. Karui stood beside him, her hand resting on her sword hilt, ready for
whatever came next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The message was simple, written in the same cipher they had
intercepted before:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The white prize grows tarnished. The dark
contamination spreads. Meet us at the Falls of Truth, or we will cleanse
both.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They're threatening to expose you,&quot; Karui said,
reading over his shoulder. &quot;To the village, to the white minority, to
everyone. They know about us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They know I care for you,&quot; Nanzo corrected, but
his voice was hollow. &quot;They don't know you return the feeling. They think
you're leverage, a weakness to be exploited.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then let's exploit their misunderstanding.&quot; Karui
turned to Omoi. &quot;Darui-sama's orders?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He wants a team. Discrete, no official affiliation. If
this goes wrong, Kumogakure needs deniability.&quot; Omoi straightened, his
usual worry replaced by professional focus. &quot;Samui-san's handling the
border patrol rotation to cover our absence. I'm your backup.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And me?&quot; Karui asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're the target.&quot; Nanzo rolled the scroll, his
jaw tight. &quot;They want to use you against me. So we let them think they
can. I go to the meeting, you follow in stealth, Omoi provides overwatch from
the ridge.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's a trap,&quot; Omoi said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Obviously.&quot; Nanzo smiled, but it wasn't a
pleasant expression. &quot;But traps work both ways. They want to catch me in a
compromising position, something that will destroy my standing with the white
minority and weaken the clan. I intend to give them exactly what they want<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>just not the way they
expect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui studied his face, seeing the calculation there, the
strategic mind that had always existed beneath the clan head persona. &quot;You
have a plan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I have physics.&quot; He moved to the weapon rack,
selecting a sword<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
his usual style, but something closer to what she had taught him. &quot;And I
have the best close-combat instructor in Kumogakure. If they want to fight in
the Falls of Truth, they'll find that water conducts sound waves beautifully.
And sound waves, properly applied, can shatter stone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Falls of Truth were located in the northern mountains, a
day's travel from the village. Legend said that the water showed travelers
their true selves, stripping away illusions and lies. Karui had always thought
it was sentimental nonsense, but standing at the base of the falls as Nanzo
approached the meeting point, she felt the weight of truth pressing down on
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was hidden in the spray, her dark skin camouflaged
against the wet rocks, her chakra suppressed to nothing. Omoi was somewhere
above, his position undetectable even to her trained senses. And Nanzo<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>her Nanzo, her love, her
partner<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>walked openly
into the clearing, wearing his white robes like a target.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Iwa agent revealed themselves with theatrical flair.
Three figures, masked, their chakra signatures masked by some technique that
made them feel like holes in the world rather than presences. They surrounded Nanzo
in a triangle, maintaining careful distance<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>ten
meters, she noted, just outside his optimal gravity range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Anitsu-sama,&quot; the lead figure said, their voice
distorted by a vocal modifier. &quot;How kind of you to accept our
invitation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't respond well to threats against those I care
about.&quot; Nanzo's voice was calm, aristocratic, the perfect performance of a
concerned clan head. &quot;State your demands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Simple. You will publicly denounce the dark girl
Karui. Declare her unfit for association with noble blood. Destroy any
reputation she has as a competent shinobi, make her a pariah in her own
village.&quot; The figure laughed, the sound grating. &quot;Or we will release
evidence of your... indiscretion. The late-night training sessions. The shared
meals. The way you look at her when you think no one sees.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And if I comply?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then your secret dies with us. The white minority
maintains their illusion of purity. The Anitsu Clan remains... unsullied.&quot;
The figure's tone made the word sound filthy. &quot;It's a small price, isn't
it? One dark girl's future for your clan's reputation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was silent for a long moment. Karui watched him from
her hiding place, her heart hammering against her ribs, her hand white-knuckled
on her sword. She knew this was part of the plan. She knew he was acting. But
the words still hurt, the possibility that he might choose purity over her,
tradition over love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're right,&quot; Nanzo said finally. &quot;It is a
small price. Too small, perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He moved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not with gravity<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he
didn't need to. Not with Wave Style<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he
was saving that. He moved with the taijutsu she had taught him, closing the
distance to the nearest agent in a burst of speed that spoke of physics applied
to human muscle, of vectors and force and the beautiful mathematics of
violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His sword struck before the agent could react, not to kill
but to disable<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
precise cut to the tendons of the wrist, dropping the weapon, followed by a
sweep that took the legs. The agent fell, screaming, their mask dislodging to
reveal a face that Karui didn't recognize but Nanzo clearly did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Kirihara,&quot; he said, standing over the fallen
agent. &quot;Iwa's deep cover operative. You've been in Kumogakure for five
years, posing as a merchant. I analyzed your chakra signature three days ago,
matched it to the resonance on the metal fragment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remaining two agents attacked simultaneously, but Nanzo
was already moving, dancing between them with a grace that made Karui's heart
swell with pride. This was her teaching, her training, transformed by his
genius into something unique. Close combat, once his weakness, now his
unexpected strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She emerged from her hiding place, her sword clearing its
sheath with a sound like a promise. The second agent turned to face her, and
she saw their eyes widen behind the mask<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>surprise
that the target was armed, that the leverage had teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wrong assumption,&quot; she said, and attacked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fight was brief and brutal. These were spies, not
frontline combatants, and they had prepared for a clan head who relied on
long-range techniques. They had not prepared for a partnership, for love
translated into coordinated violence, for physics and steel working in perfect
harmony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it was over, two agents were unconscious, one was
bleeding from a wound that would need immediate attention, and Nanzo stood in
the center of the clearing, his white robes splattered with mud and blood, his
chest heaving, his eyes bright with something that looked like joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Partners,&quot; he said, looking at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Partners,&quot; she agreed, lowering her sword.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Omoi descended from the ridge, his expression impressed
despite himself. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, surveying the carnage. &quot;That
was... efficient.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Physics,&quot; Nanzo said, cleaning his blade with a
cloth that appeared from his sleeve. &quot;And excellent training. Karui,
remind me to thank you properly later.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh, I'll remind you.&quot; She sheathed her sword,
moving to stand beside him, not touching but close enough to feel his heat.
&quot;So what now? We have prisoners, intelligence about Iwa's operations, and
proof that they were trying to blackmail a clan head. Darui-sama will want a
full report.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Darui-sama will want more than that.&quot; Nanzo
looked at the prisoners, his expression shifting from warrior to statesman.
&quot;These three are the beginning. Iwa has been infiltrating our village for
years, playing on the divisions between the white minority and the dark
majority. They've been feeding the gossip, encouraging the prejudice, trying to
destabilize us from within.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Using you as the wedge,&quot; Karui realized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Using us.&quot; He turned to face her, his yellow eyes
serious. &quot;Our relationship<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>real
or perceived<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>was their
weapon. They thought that threatening you would control me. They thought that
destroying your reputation would break me.&quot; He reached out, taking her
hand, ignoring Omoi's presence, ignoring everything but the truth between them.
&quot;They were wrong. You are not my weakness, Karui. You are my strength. The
reason I fight, the reason I grow, the reason I refuse to be just what I was
born to be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo...&quot; She felt tears prick her eyes, stubborn
and unwelcome. &quot;We're in the middle of a mission. Omoi is right
there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Omoi is a trusted comrade who understands that some
things are more important than propriety.&quot; Nanzo raised her hand to his
lips, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. &quot;I love you. I will say it in front
of the Raikage, in front of my mother, in front of the entire village. I am Nanzo
Anitsu, clan head, survivor, and I am in love with Karui of Kumogakure, the
stubborn dark girl who defeated me and made me whole.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Omoi coughed, looking studiously at the sky. &quot;I'll, uh,
secure the prisoners. Take your time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui laughed, the sound breaking through her tears, and
pulled Nanzo into a kiss that tasted of blood and victory and the beginning of
something that could not be stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Falls of Truth roared behind them, and if the water
showed them their true selves, they were brave enough to look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 6: The Announcement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They returned to Kumogakure as dawn broke over the
mountains, their prisoners secured, their report prepared, their hands clasped
together where anyone could see. The village was waking, the dark majority
beginning their daily routines, the white minority stirring in their privileged
compounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui received them in his private chambers, his expression
unreadable as he listened to their report. When they finished, he sat in
silence for a long moment, his fingers steepled beneath his chin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Iwa has been playing a long game,&quot; he said
finally. &quot;Using our own divisions against us. It's clever. Cruel, but
clever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We can use this,&quot; Nanzo said. &quot;The prisoners
will talk. We can trace their network, expose the other agents, turn their
strategy back on them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And the personal element?&quot; Darui's eyes moved
between them, noting their joined hands, the matching bruises, the way they
stood slightly too close. &quot;The blackmail attempt, the threat to
Karui-san?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Was unsuccessful.&quot; Nanzo's grip tightened on her
fingers. &quot;As it will always be unsuccessful. I am making a formal
declaration, Darui-sama. Karui and I are... together. Partners. In all things.
Anyone who threatens her threatens me, and I will respond with the full force
of the Anitsu Clan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your mother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Will learn to accept it. Or she will learn to live
with disappointment.&quot; Nanzo's voice was steel. &quot;I am clan head. My
choices are mine to make. And I choose her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui studied them for a long moment, then smiled<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that rare, genuine
expression that transformed his face from lazy politician to legendary shinobi.
&quot;About time,&quot; he said. &quot;The village has been taking bets on when
you'd make it official. I had three weeks from today in the pool.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt her jaw drop. &quot;You knew?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Everyone knew, kid.&quot; Darui rose, moving to the
window. &quot;The way you two look at each other? It's not subtle. The only
question was whether Nanzo would grow the spine to admit it publicly.&quot; He
turned back, his expression serious. &quot;But know this<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>making it official changes things. The white
minority will react. There will be pressure, gossip, maybe threats. Are you
prepared for that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We are,&quot; they said together, and Karui felt the
rightness of it, the unity that made them stronger than either could be alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then go,&quot; Darui said. &quot;Make your
announcement. Deal with the fallout. And when you're ready, come back to me
with a plan for rooting out Iwa's network. We'll need the Anitsu Clan's unique
capabilities<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and your
partner's particular skills.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They left the Raikage's tower into the full morning light,
and Nanzo turned to her with a question in his eyes. &quot;Publicly?&quot; he
asked. &quot;Now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Now,&quot; she confirmed. &quot;No more hiding. No
more pretending to be allies or teacher and student. We walk through the
village together, and we let them see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through the market districts, where dark-skinned vendors
called out greetings to Karui and fell silent when they saw her hand in Nanzo's.
Through the training grounds, where Killer B looked up from his rap practice
and flashed them a thumbs-up that suggested he had known all along. Through the
administrative quarter, where white minority officials stared and whispered and
turned away with expressions of disgust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui held her head high, her amber eyes challenging anyone
who dared meet her gaze. She was dark, she was stubborn, she was loud, and she
was loved by the most powerful clan head in Kumogakure. Let them whisper. Let
the thirty percent feel their minority status acutely, surrounded by the
seventy percent who looked like her and accepted her as one of their own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the Anitsu compound  gates, they paused. Nora would be
inside, preparing breakfast, perhaps, or arranging flowers, or engaging in any
of the countless rituals that maintained the illusion of a world that no longer
existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Together,&quot; Nanzo said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Together,&quot; she agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora met them in the main hall, her posture perfect, her
face a mask of polite inquiry. But Karui saw the moment she noticed their
joined hands, the slight widening of her yellow eyes, the way her fingers
tightened on the fan she carried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo,&quot; she said, her voice carefully neutral.
&quot;You're back early. I wasn't expecting you until<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom.&quot; He released Karui's hand, but only to place
his arm around her shoulders, drawing her close. &quot;Karui and I have
something to tell you. Something the village will know by nightfall.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora's fan snapped open, hiding the lower half of her face.
&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We're together. Romantically. Partners in life as well
as combat.&quot; He spoke quickly, as if speed could soften the blow. &quot;I
love her. She loves me. We're going to build a future together, here in this
compound, with the clan. And I need you to accept that. Not just tolerate it<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>accept it. Because she is
going to be my wife, and the mother of my children, and your daughter-in-law,
and I will not have her treated as anything less than family.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The silence stretched between them, heavy and dangerous.
Karui felt Nora's eyes on her, assessing, judging, seeing all the things she
had always seen: dark skin, stubborn jaw, loud presence, the pollution of
purity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Nora closed her fan. Her hands were trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You've made your choice,&quot; she said, her voice
barely above a whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I have.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And if I cannot accept it? If I look at her and see everything
that will destroy what your father died to protect?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then you will lose me too.&quot; Nanzo's voice was
gentle but unyielding. &quot;I don't want that. I love you, Mom. You've raised
me, trained me, been my family when I had no one. But I am not a child anymore.
I am clan head, and I choose her. I choose life and change and a future that
isn't defined by blood purity and extinct traditions. And if that choice
excludes you, I will grieve. But I will not change it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora looked at him<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>really
looked<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and Karui saw
something break in her expression. The mask of the perfect mother, the guardian
of purity, cracked to reveal the woman beneath: afraid, grieving, loving her
son so much that it had become a kind of poison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I need time,&quot; Nora said finally. &quot;Time to...
to understand. To see what you see in her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Take the time you need.&quot; Nanzo stepped forward,
embracing his mother, and Karui saw Nora stiffen before slowly, reluctantly,
returning the gesture. &quot;But know that she is part of my life now. Part of
our family. And I believe, if you let yourself, you could come to love her
too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora's eyes met Karui's over Nanzo's shoulder, and in them
Karui saw no love, no acceptance<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>only
a desperate, drowning fear. But there was something else too, something that
might grow into tolerance, if not affection: the recognition that Karui loved
him too, that she had risked her life for him, that she was not the monster
Nora had imagined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We'll see,&quot; Nora said. And for now, that was
enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 7: The Wedding of Waves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Six months later, Kumogakure celebrated the wedding of Nanzo
Anitsu and Karui of the Hidden Cloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was not the wedding the white minority had envisioned for
their precious Prince. There was no weeks-long purification ritual, no
exclusive guest list of pale-skinned nobility, no emphasis on the preservation
of bloodline purity. Instead, the ceremony was held in the village's central
plaza, open to all, with Darui himself officiating and Killer B providing
entertainment that was arguably inappropriate for a formal occasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui wore white<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
deliberate choice, a claiming of the color that had always been used to exclude
her. Her dress was simple, cut for movement rather than display, and she
carried her sword instead of flowers. Her skin glowed dark against the silk,
her amber eyes defiant, her red hair crowned with a circlet of silver waves
that Nanzo had designed himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo wore black. The color of the majority, of the village
that had raised her, of the future they were building together. His white skin
seemed to shine against it, his yellow eyes bright with an emotion that made
Karui's heart ache. Around his neck, visible to all, was the scar from her bite<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the mark she had given him
when he was helpless, now displayed as proudly as any medal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The vows they wrote themselves, rejecting the traditional Anitsu
Clan language of purity and preservation in favor of something new:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I take you not to maintain what was, but to create
what will be,&quot; Nanzo said, his voice carrying across the silent crowd.
&quot;Not as master and servant, not as purity and pollution, but as partners.
Equals. Two waves that meet and merge and become something stronger than either
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I take you not despite your darkness, but because of
it,&quot; Karui replied, her voice steady despite the tears she refused to
shed. &quot;Not to tame you or change you, but to grow with you. To fight
beside you, to challenge you, to love you in all your complicated, stubborn,
beautiful humanity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they kissed, the crowd erupted<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>dark-skinned majority cheering their own,
white minority watching in stunned silence, the village acknowledging that
something fundamental had shifted. The Anitsu Clan was no longer an isolated
bastion of purity. It was changing, adapting, becoming part of the larger world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And in the front row, Nora Anitsu stood with her hands
clasped so tightly that her knuckles were white, watching her son smile in a
way she had never seen before, watching the dark girl who had somehow made him
whole, and trying<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>truly
trying<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>to find
happiness in his happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later, at the reception, she approached Karui alone. The new
bride was watching Nanzo dance with Killer B<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>an
absurd spectacle that involved too much enthusiasm and questionable rhythm<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and her expression was soft
in a way that Nora had never seen directed at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui-san,&quot; Nora said, the honorific feeling
strange in her mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nora-san.&quot; Karui turned, her defenses immediately
rising, her body shifting into a combat-ready stance that was probably
unconscious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I wanted to give you something.&quot; Nora held out a
small box, her hands steady through sheer force of will. &quot;It belonged to Nanzo's
mother. She wore it on her wedding day, and her mother before her. I had
thought... I had hoped to give it to a bride who matched our... our standards.
But I was wrong. About many things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui took the box, opening it to reveal a necklace<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>simple, elegant, a pendant
shaped like a wave that seemed to move when the light hit it. &quot;It's
beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is tradition,&quot; Nora said carefully. &quot;But
tradition can change. You are changing it. And I am trying to change with it.
For him. Because he loves you, and I love him, and perhaps... perhaps that is
enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui looked at her<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>really
looked<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and saw the
effort it cost, the battle that Nora was fighting against her own prejudice,
her own fear. It wasn't acceptance. It wasn't even true tolerance. But it was a
beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Karui said, and meant it. She
fastened the necklace around her throat, the wave pendant resting against her
dark skin, and saw Nora's eyes widen slightly at the contrast<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the white gold against her
complexion, the traditional symbol worn in a new way. &quot;I'll take care of
him. I promise. Not because he needs protecting, but because we protect each
other.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know,&quot; Nora whispered. &quot;I have seen it. In
the laboratory, when you ran into the resonance field. In the missions, when
you fight together. You make him stronger. I cannot deny that, even when I wish
to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned to leave, but Karui stopped her with a hand on her
arm. &quot;Nora-san. I don't expect you to love me. I don't even expect you to
like me. But I hope, someday, you might respect me. As a shinobi, as a partner
to your son, as someone who is trying to build something good in this broken
world.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora looked at the hand on her arm<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>dark fingers against her white sleeve, the
physical reality of their difference that she had always found so threatening.
Then she did something that surprised them both: she covered Karui's hand with
her own, briefly, a gesture of acknowledgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Respect,&quot; she said, tasting the word. &quot;Yes.
I think... I think I can manage respect. In time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She left then, moving through the crowd toward the
compound's quiet interior, and Karui watched her go with complex emotions. The
war wasn't over. Nora still looked at her and saw darkness, still feared the
future, still struggled with the minority's terror of being overwhelmed. But
there was a truce now, a space for possibility, and that was more than Karui
had expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She spoke to you.&quot; Nanzo appeared at her side,
slightly breathless from dancing, his yellow eyes concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She gave me your mother's necklace.&quot; Karui
touched the pendant. &quot;And she promised to try. That's something, isn't
it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's everything.&quot; He drew her into his arms,
beginning to move with the music, his body swaying against hers. &quot;Thank
you. For being patient with her. For not giving up on this family, even when it
would be easier to walk away.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't walk away from fights,&quot; Karui reminded
him, resting her head against his shoulder. &quot;And I don't walk away from
you. We're partners, remember? Stubborn, damaged, complicated partners, bound
by teeth marks and training sessions and the stubborn refusal to be what
everyone expects.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Till death,&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And beyond,&quot; she promised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The music swelled around them, the celebration of a village
that was learning to change, and in the center of the dance floor, dark and
pale, stubborn and scared, they moved together as one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 8: The Secret of Origins</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One year after the wedding, Nanzo stood in the deepest
chamber of the Anitsu compound , a space that existed on no map and was known
only to the clan head. The walls were covered in seals that predated the
village itself, written in a language that was not quite of this world,
describing truths that could break minds unprepared for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was not supposed to bring anyone here. The secret of the Anitsu
Clan's origin was for the clan head alone, passed down through generations in a
chain of knowledge that stretched back to the <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Karui stood beside him, her hand in his, and he had
promised her partnership in all things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Shibai <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki,&quot;
he said, his voice echoing in the sealed space. &quot;The progenitor. The
source of our Wave Style, our yellow eyes, our connection to the fundamental
forces of the universe. Our bloodline is not just a mutation or evolution<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it is inheritance. Direct,
unbroken, from a being that transcended this world.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui stared at the walls, at the images that seemed to move
when viewed from the corner of one's eye. &quot;You're saying your clan is
descended from gods?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;From one god. One who experimented on this world, who
left behind fragments of power that became what we call Kekkei Genkai.&quot; Nanzo
touched the central seal, feeling it pulse in recognition of his blood.
&quot;The Uchiha have their Sharingan from another branch. The Hy<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>ga their Byakugan. And
we... we have the waves. The ability to manipulate the fundamental vibrations
of reality.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; Karui turned to
face him, her amber eyes serious. &quot;This is clan head knowledge. Sacred,
secret, all those things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because there is more.&quot; He led her to a pedestal
at the chamber's center, upon which rested a scroll that seemed to absorb light
rather than reflect it. &quot;The Waver Mode. Our ultimate technique. Only two
people in history have ever used it<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
founder, and potentially me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He unrolled the scroll, revealing diagrams that made Karui's
head ache to look at. Chakra pathways that shouldn't exist, techniques that
required the user to become something other than human, to merge with the wave
nature of reality itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It grants godlike power,&quot; Nanzo continued, his
voice hollow. &quot;Control over all waves within a two-hundred-kilometer
radius. Chakra, sound, electromagnetic, seismic<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>everything.
For thirty minutes, the user is effectively invincible. And then they die. The
body cannot sustain that level of transformation. It burns out, consumes
itself, leaves nothing but ash.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt cold fear spread through her chest. &quot;You've
never used it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you never will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo.&quot; She grabbed his shoulders, forcing him to
look at her. &quot;Promise me. Promise me you will never use this. Not for the
village, not for me, not for anything. Promise me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can't promise that.&quot; His eyes were wet,
desperate. &quot;If the village is destroyed, if you're threatened, if there's
no other way... Karui, I would give anything to protect you. Even my life.
Especially my life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then find another way!&quot; She shook him, her temper
breaking through. &quot;You're the smartest person I know. You understand
physics, chakra dynamics, sealing techniques that no one else has even
imagined. Find another way to be strong that doesn't involve killing
yourself!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm trying!&quot; He pulled her close, burying his
face in her hair, his body shaking. &quot;I'm trying, Karui. I've been
researching alternatives, training to increase my base power, developing new
techniques so I'll never need the Waver Mode. But I need you to understand<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>if it comes to that choice,
if it's the only way to save you, I will use it. And I need you to forgive me
in advance for that choice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She held him, feeling his fear and his love and his
desperate, stubborn willingness to sacrifice everything for her safety. And she
made a silent vow, there in the chamber of secrets, that she would never let
that choice become necessary. That she would fight beside him, protect him,
challenge him to find another way, until the day they both died of old age in
each other's arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't forgive you,&quot; she said finally. &quot;But
I understand you. And I will fight you on this, Nanzo. Every day, every
mission, every threat. I will be strong enough that you never need to consider
that scroll. I will be your partner in truth, not just in words.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's all I ask,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Just...
stay with me. Keep me human. Keep me from becoming a god, even when the power
tempts me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I promise,&quot; she said. And unlike his impossible
promise, hers was one she knew she could keep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both sleep in bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Atmosphere: Pre-dawn darkness, rain against windows, Nanzo
and Karui asleep in shared bed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Descent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was dreaming of waves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not the violent, destructive waves of his clan's techniques,
but gentle ocean waves<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>rhythmic,
eternal, the sound his mother must have heard in the womb before she died
protecting him. He was floating in an endless golden sea, weightless, peaceful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the sea turned inside out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The water became sky. The sky became flesh. Nanzo found
himself standing on a surface that was simultaneously stone, cloud, and the
surface of an eye<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>massive,
lidless, blinking in slow, geological time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He knew this place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
Dimension. The realm of gods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Finally.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The voice didn't speak<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it
resonated. It vibrated through every atom of Nanzo's being, making his teeth
ache, his bones hum, his Wave Style chakra scream in recognition. This was no
Genjutsu. No ordinary mind technique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was a direct neural transmission from a being that existed
beyond conventional reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo turned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
stood<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>or rather,
existed<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>before him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The progenitor of the Anitsu Clan's secret bloodline. The
being whose divine DNA had been passed down through centuries, mutating into
the Wave Style Kekkei Genkai. The god who had abandoned his mortal shell to
become pure chakra, pure will, pure hunger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had no fixed form. He was a silhouette of golden light
and absolute darkness, shifting between humanoid shapes and geometric
impossibilities<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>sometimes
with horns, sometimes with the Rinnegan's concentric rings, sometimes with
nothing at all but a pressure that made Nanzo's soul want to kneel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo Anitsu.&quot; The name was a caress and a
command. &quot;My youngest son's most stubborn descendant. Do you know how long
I have watched you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's hands moved instinctively to form seals, but he had
no hands here<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>only
concept. He was thought. He was dream-stuff. He was vulnerable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Since your mother burned herself to protect you.&quot;
Shibai's form flickered, showing a ghost-image of Nyoko's Final Resonance<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>her body dissolving into
golden light. &quot;Such waste. Such delicious, desperate waste. She could have
been so much more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't you DARE speak of her.&quot; Nanzo's voice<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his dream-voice<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>crackled with Wave Style
resonance. Even here, even disembodied, his chakra remembered its nature. The
golden sea around them rippled with his anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai laughed. The sound was supernovas dying. It was the
silence between heartbeats. It was every nightmare Nanzo had ever suppressed
since the massacre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Brave. Foolish. You have always been my favorite
flavor of descendant.&quot; The god-thing circled him, leaving trails of
stardust and decay. &quot;Do you know why the Uchiha truly attacked your clan?
Why Fugaku feared you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo said nothing. His dream-heart was pounding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because I whispered to him.&quot; Shibai's voice
dropped to an intimate, horrible intimacy. &quot;In his Mangeky<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> dreams. I showed him the
future where Anitsu Clan children grew strong enough to disrupt not just
Genjutsu... but Divine Techniques. The techniques of gods. My techniques.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The revelation hit Nanzo like a physical blow. &quot;You...
you caused the massacre?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I encouraged it.&quot; Shibai's form split into a
smile with too many teeth. &quot;Your clan was becoming too numerous. Too
visible. The Wave Style was evolving beyond my design<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>your mother's Final Resonance touched the
edges of my power. That could not be allowed. Better to cull the herd, leave
only the strongest...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He reached out with fingers that were also galaxies, also
swords, also the hands of Nanzo's dead father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;...and guide the survivor to his true purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The golden sea transformed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly they stood in a garden<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>if gardens were made of floating continents
and trees that bore fruit of compressed starlight. Nanzo recognized it from the
clan's most forbidden texts: The Divine Tree Orchard, where <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki gods cultivated
chakra fruit from devoured worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other figures materialized in the distance<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Isshiki, Kaguya, Momoshiki,
Kinshiki, Urashiki<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>all
the <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki who had
descended upon the ninja world throughout history. They were silhouettes,
watching, waiting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The harvest approaches,&quot; Shibai said. &quot;This
world<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>your precious
'Earth'<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>ripens.
Kaguya's betrayal delayed it, but the fruit will be ready within your
lifetime.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned fully to Nanzo, and for a moment, he had a face<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nanzo's own face, but
perfected, immortal, crowned with horns of pure chakra.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Join us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The offer resonated through every layer of Nanzo's being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Abandon this fragile mortal shell. I will remake you
as my successor<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a true
<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki, not merely
a diluted descendant. You will have immortality. You will drink the chakra
fruit's nectar and transcend death itself. Your Wave Style will become Divine
Wave Style<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>capable of
shattering dimensions, not merely organs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai's eyes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>now
fully Rinnegan, now Byakugan, now something beyond both<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>burned with terrible promise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;In return, you will help us harvest. You will identify
the strongest chakra signatures on Earth<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
jinch<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>riki, the Kage,
the kekkei genkai masters. You will prepare them for consumption. And when the
Divine Tree blooms...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He extended his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;...you will be there to eat first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo looked at the hand that had orchestrated his parents'
murder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at the face that wore his own features like a
mask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at the &quot;god&quot; who had reduced his
mother's sacrifice to &quot;delicious waste.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It started as a chuckle<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>disbelieving,
bitter. It grew into full-throated, hysterical laughter that made the golden
sea churn and the Divine Tree Orchard tremble. Nanzo laughed until his
dream-form flickered, until tears that weren't real streamed down his face,
until Shibai's expression shifted from confidence to confusion to cold, ancient
rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You... find this amusing?&quot; The god's voice was
the pressure of collapsing stars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Amusing?&quot; Nanzo gasped, wiping phantom tears.
&quot;No. Pathetic. You're pathetic.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He stepped forward, dream-form solidifying with sheer force
of will, and spat at Shibai's feet<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
golden sand of this divine realm hissing where his contempt landed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You think I want your immortality? Your 'Divine Wave
Style'? I've seen what godhood does to your kind. Kaguya went mad. Isshiki
became a parasite. Momoshiki was so desperate for power he ate his own
partner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He circled the god now, his voice dropping to a snarl that
would have done his wife proud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You abandoned your body to become... this.&quot; He
gestured at Shibai's shifting, formless presence. &quot;Pure chakra? Pure will?
You're nothing. You're a ghost haunting your own descendants, too cowardly to
die, too weak to truly live. You whisper in dreams because you can't walk in
reality. You 'encourage' massacres because you're impotent to act
directly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai's form darkened. The golden sea turned black. The
distant <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
silhouettes began to move closer, sensing their progenitor's fury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You know what I think of when I wake up
screaming?&quot; Nanzo pressed, relentless. &quot;Not you. Not your 'divine'
power. I think of my mother burning to save me. I think of my father's last
breath. I think of Nora<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>eight
years old<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>holding my
baby self while her entire family died around her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He leaned into Shibai's darkness, unafraid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They gave me mortality, you cosmic parasite. They gave
me limits, and pain, and love<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>real
love, not this... this consumption you call godhood. My wife bites my neck and
I feel alive. You haven't felt anything in millennia.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The god's rage was now a physical force, crushing,
suffocating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You DARE<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I DARE.&quot; Nanzo shouted back, his Wave Style
resonance finally manifesting in this dream-realm<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>golden
ripples of defiant chakra pushing back against Shibai's darkness. &quot;I am Nanzo
Anitsu! Last heir of a clan YOU murdered! Husband to the woman who defeated me!
Master of Wave Style, Wind Style, Gravity Manipulation<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>techniques I BUILT with physics and pain and
choice!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He straightened, and for a moment, he was more solid than
the god before him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't need your immortality. I don't want your
successorship. I would rather die in thirty minutes using Waver Mode to protect
my wife than live forever as your appetite.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, slowly, the darkness receded<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but not in defeat. In promise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You refuse.&quot; It was not a question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Obviously.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You mock me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thoroughly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai's form condensed into something almost human<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>beautiful, terrible,
smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then remember this, little wave:&quot; The god's voice
dropped to a whisper that would echo in Nanzo's skull for the rest of his life.
&quot;When the harvest comes. When your precious wife's chakra ripens. When
this world burns and the fruit is plucked...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He leaned close, breath that smelled of dead worlds and
aborted futures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;...I will come for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The smile widened, showing teeth that were also tombstones,
also the shards of the moon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you will watch me consume everything you love,
descendant. You will watch because I will make you last. I will make you taste
immortality as the sole survivor<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>again<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>before I unmake your very
concept.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo felt himself being ejected<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the dream-realm rejecting his defiance,
Shibai's will thrusting him back toward consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Sleep well, Nanzo Anitsu,&quot; the god's voice
followed him through the void. &quot;Dream of waves. Dream of your mother's
burning. Dream of me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Waking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo jolted awake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His own gasp was loud in the dark bedroom. He was drenched
in sweat, his black wolf-hair plastered to his forehead, his yellow eyes wide
and unseeing. His heart hammered against his ribs like it wanted to escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a terrible moment, he could still feel Shibai's presence<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>could still smell the
ozone-and-rot scent of the <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
realm. His left hand went instinctively to his neck, to the bite scar Karui had
left there, grounding himself in physical reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui's voice<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>sleep-rough,
concerned<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>cut through
the lingering terror like a blade through silk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was already sitting up, amber eyes alert despite having
been deeply asleep moments before. Jonin reflexes. Killer B's training. Her
hand was on the sword she kept beneath her pillow, but her eyes were scanning
him<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>checking for
injury, for Genjutsu, for threat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What happened?&quot; she demanded. &quot;You're
shaking. Your chakra... it feels wrong. Like it's still vibrating at some
frequency I can't hear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo opened his mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shibai <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki
contacted me. The god of our clan's secret bloodline. He offered me immortality.
I refused. He threatened to destroy everything I love. He'll come for us. For
you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at his wife<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his
wife, dark and beautiful and alive, wearing one of his oversized shirts to bed,
her red hair mussed from sleep, her wrist tattoo of his face catching the
moonlight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He thought of Shibai's promise: &quot;When your precious
wife's chakra ripens.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He thought of her Final Resonance<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>burning herself to protect what she loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lie tasted like ash, but it tasted better than fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui's eyes narrowed. She knew him too well<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>knew every
micro-expression, every tells from their years of sparring, their marriage,
their bond. She knew he was lying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she also knew he would tell her when he was ready. Or
when he needed to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She reached out, her dark hand finding his pale one in the
darkness, intertwining their fingers. Her thumb traced the back of his hand<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a gesture of comfort, of
presence, of I am here and I am real and I am not going anywhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing,&quot; she repeated, not believing him for a
second, but accepting the lie for now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She pulled him back down to the mattress, arranging them so
that his head rested on her chest<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>close
enough to hear her heartbeat, to feel her warmth, to smell the scent he had
once called his addiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Sleep,&quot; she commanded softly, her hand in his
hair. &quot;Whatever it was, it can't have you tonight. I won't let it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo closed his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the darkness behind his lids, Shibai's final whisper
still echoed: &quot;I will come for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But here, in the warmth of his wife's arms, with her
heartbeat a steady drum against his ear and her sword within arm's reach, Nanzo
found the strength to whisper back<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>if
only to himself:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Let him come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He pressed closer to Karui, breathing in her scent<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>life, mortality, love<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and finally, fitfully,
slept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 9: The Mission to the Land of Waves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The assignment came through standard channels: investigate
disturbances in the Land of Waves, a small nation that had once been oppressed
by the criminal Gat<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
but had since become a peaceful ally of the Hidden Leaf. Now, something was
disrupting their shipping lanes, sinking vessels without trace, leaving no
survivors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui assigned the mission to Team Samui, with Nanzo
attached as a specialist consultant. It was the first time Karui would work
with her old team since her marriage, and she felt the complexity of the
situation as they gathered at the village gates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samui looked the same<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>cool,
professional, her blonde hair immaculate. Omoi looked different, somehow older,
his worried expression replaced by something more settled. And Nanzo...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo wore his formal mission gear, the white armor of the Anitsu
Clan adapted for travel, his sword at his hip. He looked every inch the clan
head, the powerful shinobi, the man who had grown beyond the Prince she had
first defeated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Newlyweds on a mission together,&quot; Omoi said, his
tone carefully neutral. &quot;This should be interesting. Or disastrous. Or
interestingly disastrous.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Shut up, Omoi,&quot; Karui said, but without heat. She
was too focused on the mission, on the reports of wave-based attacks that had
drawn Darui's attention and Nanzo's concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Land of Waves,&quot; Nanzo said, studying the map.
&quot;Appropriately named. If our theoretical enemy is using wave-techniques,
this environment would amplify their power significantly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Or yours,&quot; Samui noted. &quot;Your clan's
abilities are wave-based as well, aren't they?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Similar but distinct.&quot; Nanzo rolled the map, his
expression serious. &quot;Which is why I'm concerned. If someone has developed
a technique that mimics our style, they could be using the ocean itself as a
weapon. That level of destruction would be... catastrophic.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They traveled in silence for the first day, moving through
the forests that separated Lightning from Water territories. Karui walked
beside Nanzo, close enough to support him if needed, far enough to maintain
professional distance in front of her team. It was a balance they were still
learning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That night, around the campfire, Omoi finally broke the
tension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So,&quot; he said, roasting a fish on a stick with
more attention than the task required. &quot;Marriage. How's that working out
for you two?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Omoi,&quot; Samui warned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What? I'm curious! It's not every day your teammate
marries the most powerful clan head in the village. I have questions.&quot; He
looked at Nanzo. &quot;Does she still call you Prince?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo smiled, the expression transforming his face from
intimidating to approachable. &quot;Only when she's annoyed with me. Which is
frequently.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you let her?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I encourage it.&quot; Nanzo's eyes found Karui across
the fire, warm with private memory. &quot;It reminds me of who I was, who I am,
who I want to be. She keeps me honest, Omoi-san. No one else in my life does
that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt her cheeks warm, grateful for the darkness that
hid her blush. &quot;He's not so bad himself,&quot; she muttered. &quot;For a Prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They laughed, the sound easing the tension, and for a moment
they were just four shinobi on a mission, partners in danger, bound by trust
rather than blood or law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the wave hit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It came without warning<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
wall of water rising from the nearby river, shaped into a hand that reached for
them with unmistakable malice. Nanzo moved first, his hands forming seals that
Karui didn't recognize, creating a counter-wave that met the attack and
dispersed it into harmless spray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Up!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Into the trees! It's
coming from the water!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They scrambled upward, finding perches in the high branches,
scanning the darkness for their attacker. The river below churned, foam rising,
and from its depths emerged a figure wrapped in seals and bandages, their
chakra signature distorted beyond recognition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Anitsu,&quot; the figure said, their voice bubbling
like water through a drowning throat. &quot;We have waited for you. The heir of
Shibai. The last carrier of true wave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Nanzo demanded, his hands ready
with seals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We are the Tide,&quot; the figure replied. &quot;The
ones who were forgotten when your ancestor ascended. We who were left behind to
drown in mortal flesh while Shibai transcended. And we have come to claim what
was promised<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>your
blood, your power, your life as sacrifice to open the path.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The figure raised their hands, and the river responded,
rising into serpents of water that struck at the trees with crushing force. Nanzo
countered with Wave Style, his own vibrations disrupting the water's cohesion,
but Karui saw the strain on his face<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>this
enemy was strong, their technique refined in ways that suggested years of
dedicated practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui!&quot; Nanzo called. &quot;The seals on their
chest! They're using stored chakra to amplify the waves<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>if you can break the containment, you'll
disrupt their power!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;On it!&quot; She leaped from her branch, sword drawn,
using the techniques she had taught him and he had enhanced with physics<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>calculating angles, using
momentum, turning her body into a projectile that closed the distance before
the water-serpents could intercept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Tide-figure saw her coming and laughed, a gurgling
sound. &quot;The dark wife! The pollution of purity! You think your steel can
harm one who commands the ocean itself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My steel,&quot; Karui grunted, parrying a water-whip,
&quot;is the least of your worries.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She struck, not at the figure but at the riverbank beneath
them, her chakra-enhanced blade cutting through stone and earth, destabilizing
the ground that supported their position. The figure stumbled, their
concentration breaking for just a moment<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and
in that moment, Nanzo struck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wave Style: Internal Resonance. A precise frequency that
bypassed the water defenses and struck directly at the seal-containment on the
figure's chest. There was a sound like breaking glass, and the stored chakra
erupted outward, throwing both combatants back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui hit a tree, the impact driving breath from her lungs,
but she forced herself up, searching for Nanzo. She found him in the river shallows,
his white armor stained with mud, his hand extended toward the collapsing
figure of their enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Who sent you?&quot; he demanded, his voice carrying
the weight of clan head authority. &quot;Who else knows the secret of
Shibai?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The figure laughed, blood bubbling from beneath their
bandages. &quot;Everyone... will know... soon. The Tide rises... Anitsu. You
cannot stop... the return. Your wife... your dark wife... will be the first to
drown... in the wave of your... ascension...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They dissolved then, becoming water, becoming nothing,
leaving only wet bandages and the echo of their threat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui stumbled to Nanzo's side, checking him for injuries,
her hands shaking with adrenaline and fear. &quot;What did they mean?
Ascending? Drowning?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't know.&quot; He stared at the empty bandages,
his expression haunted. &quot;But I intend to find out. The Tide... they're
connected to Shibai's original followers. The ones who were left behind when my
ancestor transcended. If they're seeking revenge, seeking to force ascension
through sacrifice...&quot; He looked at her, and she saw the fear in his eyes.
&quot;They want me to use the Waver Mode, Karui. They want me to burn out, to
become like Shibai, to leave this world behind. And they think that threatening
you is the way to force that choice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then we stop them.&quot; She helped him stand, her
grip firm on his arm. &quot;Together. Before they can force anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Together,&quot; he agreed. But his eyes remained on
the water, where the bandages floated like a warning, and she knew he was
thinking of the chamber deep beneath the compound, and the power that could
save everything at the cost of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 10: The Tide Rises</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The investigation led them to the Land of Waves' coast, to a
village that had been abandoned for years, ever since Gat<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>'s reign of terror. Now it
was occupied again, but not by living people. The buildings were filled with
water, shaped into forms that mimicked human habitation<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>tables of ice, chairs of compressed liquid,
curtains of falling spray that somehow maintained their form against gravity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Tide's sanctuary,&quot; Samui observed, her voice
low. &quot;They've transformed the entire village into a temple of water.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's beautiful,&quot; Omoi said, and he wasn't wrong.
In the moonlight, the water-structures glowed with an ethereal light, blue and
green and silver. &quot;And completely terrifying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo moved through the streets with the confidence of
someone who understood what they were seeing. &quot;Wave resonance,&quot; he
explained, touching a pillar of spinning water that hummed beneath his fingers.
&quot;They're using the same principles as my clan, but applied externally
rather than internally. Instead of manipulating their own chakra waves, they're
manipulating the waves in the environment. It's less powerful but more
versatile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Can you counter it?&quot; Karui asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes. But not without significant destruction.&quot; He
looked at the water-structures, at the artistry and the madness combined.
&quot;If I use my full power here, I'll destroy the entire village. And
possibly trigger geological instability that could affect the whole
region.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then we do this quietly,&quot; Samui decided.
&quot;Infiltration, not assault. Find their leader, learn their plans, disrupt
their operations with minimal collateral damage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Agreed.&quot; Nanzo looked at Karui, a question in his
eyes. &quot;Can you handle close combat in a water-rich environment? Your
lightning techniques...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Will be less effective, yes. But I'm not just
lightning.&quot; She drew her sword, feeling the balance of it, the weight that
had become familiar as her own arm. &quot;I'm the woman who defeated you in a
forest, remember? I don't need elemental advantages to be dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He smiled, that rare expression that made her heart stutter.
&quot;I remember. I will always remember.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They split up, Samui and Omoi taking the northern sector
while Karui and Nanzo moved toward the central structure<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a temple of water that rose higher than the
surrounding buildings, its spires reaching toward the moon like grasping
fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The interior was a maze of liquid walls and floors that
solidified only when stepped upon. Karui moved carefully, her chakra control
precise, maintaining her balance on surfaces that shifted and flowed. Nanzo
walked beside her with easier confidence, his Wave Style allowing him to sense
the stability of each step before he took it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They know we're here,&quot; he murmured, his hand
brushing hers in the darkness. &quot;The water is responding to our presence,
carrying information to the center.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then let's not keep them waiting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They emerged into a central chamber, a cathedral of water
where the moonlight streamed through a ceiling of liquid glass, casting
everything in shifting blue light. And at the center, waiting for them, was a
figure that made Nanzo stop short.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was old, older than Nora, her skin wrinkled and pale,
her eyes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not yellow,
but blue, the color of deep water<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>fixed
on them with an expression of terrible recognition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo,&quot; she said, her voice carrying the weight
of tides. &quot;Grandson of my sister. Last heir of the line that abandoned
us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Grandson?&quot; Karui looked at Nanzo, saw the shock
on his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My father's sister,&quot; he whispered. &quot;She was
reported killed in the Second War. We thought... the entire branch family was
thought destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not destroyed,&quot; the old woman said.
&quot;Transformed. We who were left behind when Shibai called the worthy<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>we found another path. The
path of the Tide, of eternal becoming, of water that never dies but only
changes form.&quot; She raised her hands, and the chamber responded, walls
becoming waves that crashed and reformed in endless cycle. &quot;I am Umi,
first of the Tide, and I have waited sixty years to complete what was begun. To
force the ascension. To make one of our blood transcend, as Shibai did, and
open the path for all of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You want me to use the Waver Mode,&quot; Nanzo said.
&quot;To burn out my life and become like Shibai.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I want you to fulfill your destiny!&quot; Umi's voice
rose, the water responding to her emotion, becoming storm. &quot;Your line has
hoarded the power for generations, using it for petty human concerns while the
true purpose was forgotten! Shibai left us behind, trapped in flesh, and only
another ascension can reopen the door! Your death will save thousands, will
allow us all to transcend, to become wave and water and eternal!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Umi's eyes moved to Karui, and her expression became
something cold and calculating. &quot;Then the dark wife dies. Slowly. Drowned
and revived and drowned again, until your heart breaks and you embrace the
power in your grief. We have studied you, Nanzo. We know that she is your
weakness, your anchor to mortality. Without her, you would ascend willingly,
joyfully, to join her in the next form of existence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui felt ice in her veins, but she didn't show fear.
Instead, she stepped forward, placing herself between Umi and Nanzo, her sword
raised. &quot;You think you know him,&quot; she said, her voice steady.
&quot;You think you know what he'll do for love. But you don't know us. You
don't know what we've built together.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know that love is a chain,&quot; Umi replied.
&quot;A weight that holds us down from our true potential. When she dies, you
will see. You will thank me for freeing you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The water attacked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not as simple waves, but as shapes<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>hands and teeth and crushing pressure, coming
from all directions at once. Nanzo responded with Wave Style, creating
counter-frequencies that disrupted the water's cohesion, but Umi was powerful,
her connection to this place giving her advantages that even his clan
techniques couldn't fully counter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui fought beside him, her sword cutting through
water-forms that reformed instantly, her body moving in the patterns she had
taught him and they had refined together. But it wasn't enough. The Tide had
prepared for this, had shaped this battlefield specifically to neutralize their
strengths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo!&quot; she called, parrying a water-spear.
&quot;We need to retreat, regroup!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We can't.&quot; He was breathing hard, his chakra
reserves depleting rapidly. &quot;If we leave, she'll follow. She'll strike at
the village, at Nora, at anyone I care about. This ends here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then end it!&quot; She grabbed his arm, forcing him to
look at her. &quot;Use what you need to use. I trust you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can't!&quot; The desperation in his voice broke her
heart. &quot;If I use the Waver Mode, I die. And I promised you<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>I promised I wouldn't leave
you. I won't break that promise, Karui. Not even to win.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Umi laughed, the sound echoing through the water-cathedral.
&quot;Noble! Foolish! You would let her die to keep your word? What kind of
love is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The kind that trusts,&quot; Karui said. She turned to
face Umi, her sword dropping to her side, her stance opening in apparent
surrender. &quot;You want him to ascend? You think that will save you? You're
wrong. Shibai didn't ascend through power. He ascended through understanding.
Through letting go of everything that tied him to this world<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>including the desire to
transcend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Philosophy!&quot; Umi sneered. &quot;Words to comfort
the weak!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Truth to challenge the strong.&quot; Karui moved
forward, walking through the water that should have drowned her, feeling Nanzo's
Wave Style creating pockets of air, of safety, of possibility. &quot;You want
to force ascension? You can't. It has to be chosen. Freely. With full
understanding of what is being left behind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She reached Umi, close enough to strike, close enough to be
struck. The old woman's eyes widened, surprised by her audacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Kill me,&quot; Karui said, &quot;and he will never
ascend. He will destroy himself trying to avenge me, or he will live broken, or
he will find another way to stop you. But he will not become what you want.
Because love isn't a chain, Umi. It's a choice. Every day, choosing to stay, to
grow, to be human. And that choice is stronger than your water, stronger than
your waves, stronger than your desperate fear of death.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Umi stared at her, and in the blue eyes, Karui saw something
shift. Doubt. Recognition. The first crack in sixty years of certainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You... you truly believe this,&quot; Umi whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I truly live it.&quot; Karui held out her hand, not as
a fighter but as a fellow human being. &quot;Come back with us. Let us help you
find another way. Your family<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nanzo's
family<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>thought you
were dead. They mourned you. They don't have to lose you again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a moment, impossibly, Umi hesitated. The water around
them calmed, the storm pausing, possibility hanging in the balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the seal on Umi's chest<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
same type that Nanzo had identified on the earlier attacker<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>began to glow red. Her eyes
widened in terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; she gasped. &quot;I didn't... I didn't
trigger it...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Umi!&quot; Nanzo lunged forward, his hands forming
seals, trying to disrupt whatever was happening. But he was too late, too
depleted, too slow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The seal exploded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not with fire, but with water<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>pure,
concentrated, pressurized water that expanded instantly to fill the chamber.
Karui felt herself lifted, thrown, the breath crushed from her lungs by the
sudden pressure. She saw Nanzo reaching for her, his mouth open in a scream she
couldn't hear, his yellow eyes wide with horror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the water closed over her head, and everything went
dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 11: The Drowning and the Rescue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consciousness returned slowly, accompanied by pain and the
desperate need to breathe. Karui coughed, water pouring from her lungs, her
body convulsing as it fought to clear itself of liquid death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Stay with me,&quot; Nanzo's voice, raw and terrified.
&quot;Karui, stay with me. Breathe. Just breathe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She opened her eyes to see him above her, his white armor
gone, his pale skin covered in cuts and bruises, his hands pressing
rhythmically on her chest. They were on the shore somewhere, the moon still
high, the water lapping gently at their feet. The water-cathedral was gone,
collapsed into the sea, leaving only wet sand and debris.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Umi?&quot; she managed, her voice a rasp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Gone. The seal was a failsafe<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>triggered remotely when she hesitated. Whoever
controls the Tide didn't want her to be reasoned with.&quot; Nanzo's hands
moved to her face, cradling it with desperate gentleness. &quot;I thought I
lost you. The pressure, the water, I couldn't reach you in time. If Samui and
Omoi hadn't arrived when they did...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Samui?&quot; Karui turned her head, saw her teammates
approaching across the beach, their own gear damaged, their expressions grim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We found their secondary base,&quot; Samui reported.
&quot;A command center. Whoever is leading the Tide wasn't here<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>they're operating remotely,
through seals and proxies. But we found intelligence. Names, locations, their
broader plan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They're targeting all the hidden villages,&quot; Omoi
added, his usual worry replaced by something harder. &quot;Not just Kumogakure.
They have agents everywhere, waiting to trigger wave-based catastrophes.
Tsunamis, earthquakes, chakra network disruptions. They want to force ascension
on a global scale<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>kill
enough people, cause enough destruction, that someone somewhere will embrace
the Waver Mode out of desperation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And open the path for all of them to transcend,&quot; Nanzo
finished, his voice hollow. &quot;A apocalypse of waves, designed to create a
god.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui forced herself to sit up, her body protesting every
movement. &quot;Then we stop them. We find their leader, we disrupt their
network, we prevent any of this from happening.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How?&quot; Nanzo asked. &quot;They're everywhere and
nowhere. We don't even know who the true leader is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We know they're afraid of reason.&quot; Karui grabbed
his hand, squeezing it with what strength she had. &quot;Umi hesitated when I
spoke to her. She was ready to listen, to change, before the seal killed her.
That means the Tide's ideology isn't as solid as they want us to believe. There
are cracks. Doubts. We find those cracks and we widen them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Divide and conquer,&quot; Samui said, nodding slowly.
&quot;Turn their own members against them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;While we hunt their leadership,&quot; Omoi added.
&quot;Cut off the head, and the body dies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was silent for a long moment, staring at the ocean
where his great-aunt had died. Then he nodded, his expression hardening into
resolve. &quot;We return to Kumogakure. We brief Darui, we mobilize our
network, we begin systematic disruption of Tide operations worldwide. And we
find their leader<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>whoever
is pulling the strings, triggering the seals, forcing good people like Umi to
die rather than think for themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He helped Karui stand, supporting her weight when her legs
threatened to give out. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; he asked softly, for her
ears only.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I will be.&quot; She leaned into him, accepting his
strength, offering her own in return. &quot;But Nanzo<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>promise me again. No matter what they do, no matter
how bad it gets, no Waver Mode. We find another way. Together.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I promise,&quot; he said. And this time, she believed
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VOLUME III: THE WAVER'S CHOICE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 12: The War of Waves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Six months. Six months of covert operations, of hunting Tide
cells across the elemental nations, of disrupting their plans and saving their
potential victims. Six months of partnership tested in fire, of love growing
stronger with each challenge overcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now they stood on the cliffs above Kumogakure, watching the
storm gather on the horizon. The Tide's final gambit. Their leader had been
identified<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a man named
Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>, once a scholar
of the Hidden Mist, now obsessed with achieving what Umi had failed to force.
He had spent decades studying Shibai's legacy, and he believed he had found a
way to trigger mass ascension without needing a willing sacrifice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He needed only a focal point. A nexus of wave energy that
could amplify his technique across the entire world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He needed Nanzo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He's coming here,&quot; Darui said, his Black
Lightning crackling with suppressed tension. &quot;Our intelligence confirms
it. He believes that if he can force Nanzo into Waver Mode near the village,
the resonance will trigger a chain reaction. Every hidden village will
experience wave-catastrophe simultaneously. Millions will die. And in the
chaos, someone<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>perhaps
multiple someones<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>will
embrace ascension out of desperation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then we evacuate,&quot; Karui said. &quot;Get everyone
out of range.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Two hundred kilometers,&quot; Nanzo whispered.
&quot;That's the Waver Mode's range. We can't evacuate the entire
continent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then we stop him before he can force your hand.&quot;
Karui turned to face her husband, her partner, her love. &quot;We fight him
here, on our terms. And we win without the Waver Mode.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How?&quot; Nanzo's voice was bleak. &quot;He's studied
my techniques. He knows my weaknesses. He'll exploit the five-meter dead zone,
force me into close combat where I'm vulnerable, make me choose between death
and ascension.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then we don't give him the choice.&quot; Karui stepped
closer, her hands on his shoulders, her eyes locked on his. &quot;We fight
together. You and me. Long range and close. Wave and steel. We show him what
partnership really means.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The storm hit at dawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
came walking across the water, the ocean itself parting before him, his body
wrapped in seals that glowed with sickly green light. He was younger than they
expected, his face unlined, his eyes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
blue of deep water, like Umi's<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>bright
with fanatical certainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo Anitsu,&quot; he called, his voice carrying
across the waves. &quot;I offer you a choice. Ascend willingly, become the god
you were born to be, and save those you love. Or resist, and watch me destroy
everything you care about until you have no choice left.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There's always a choice,&quot; Nanzo replied, his own
voice amplified by Wave Style resonance. &quot;You just don't like the ones
that don't end with you getting what you want.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
smiled, and the water rose behind him, forming into shapes<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>giants, monsters, the
entire ocean become an army. &quot;Then let me narrow your options.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The battle was unlike anything Karui had experienced. Kaiy<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> didn't fight directly; he
commanded the environment, turning the sea itself into a weapon that struck
from all directions at once. Nanzo countered with Wave Style, disrupting the
water's coherence, creating zones of stability in the chaos, but it was a
losing proposition. For every wave he stopped, three more rose. For every
attack he deflected, Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
simply reshaped the water and struck again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui fought through it, her sword cutting through
water-forms, her body moving in the patterns she had taught Nanzo, the
partnership that made them stronger than either alone. But she couldn't reach
Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>. He stayed
safely distant, beyond her sword's reach, beyond even Nanzo's optimal gravity
range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He's wearing you down,&quot; she called to Nanzo,
parrying a water-spear. &quot;Forcing you to expend chakra until you're
desperate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know.&quot; He was breathing hard, his white armor
stained with salt and blood. &quot;He's trying to make me use the Waver Mode.
He thinks that if he pushes me hard enough, I'll choose ascension just to stop
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Will you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at her, and she saw the exhaustion in his eyes,
the temptation, the desperate calculation of whether thirty minutes of godhood
might be worth the price.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I promised. I promised
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then trust me.&quot; She sheathed her sword, a gesture
that made Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> pause,
that made Nanzo stare. &quot;Trust me, and do exactly what I say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She explained quickly, her voice low, her plan desperate and
dangerous and possibly suicidal. But Nanzo listened, and his eyes lit with
understanding, and when she finished, he kissed her<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>hard, brief, a promise and a farewell in one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Together,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Together,&quot; she agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She ran.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not away, but toward Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>,
sprinting across the water's surface with chakra-enhanced speed, closing the
distance that had kept her from him. Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
laughed, raising his hands to summon a wall of water that would crush her, that
would end this annoying gnat who thought she could challenge a god.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Nanzo moved too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gravity Manipulation. The technique he had created, unique
to him, that could lock even gods in place. He activated it at maximum range,
catching Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> in the
field, freezing him for one precious minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One minute. Sixty seconds. The same duration that had doomed
him in the forest, all those years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
laughed, even as he couldn't move. &quot;Fool! You know what this costs you!
Thirty-minute cooldown, no gravity, no wave style for fifteen minutes! You'll
be helpless!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know,&quot; Nanzo said. He was running too,
following Karui, closing the distance to his own dead zone. &quot;But I'm not
helpless. I haven't been helpless for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui reached Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
as the gravity field released. The water wall collapsed without his direction,
becoming simple ocean again. She was inside his guard, inside the space where
he had thought himself safe, and her sword was already moving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He tried to counter with water, with wave techniques, but
she was too close, too fast, too well-trained by the woman who had defeated the
most powerful clan head in Kumogakure. Her blade struck the seals on his chest<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not to kill, but to
disrupt, to destroy the containment that allowed him to command the ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No!&quot; Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
screamed as his power unraveled. &quot;You can't! I am the Tide! I am the
future!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're a man who forgot how to be human,&quot; Karui
said, her sword at his throat. &quot;And I'm the woman who remembers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo reached them then, entering the five-meter zone where his
long-range techniques were useless, where he had once been completely
vulnerable. But he wasn't vulnerable anymore. He had trained for this. He had
prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Close combat. Taijutsu. The sword techniques that Karui had
taught him, enhanced by his understanding of physics and force. He struck Kaiy<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> precisely, scientifically,
targeting nerve clusters and pressure points with a precision that no pure
warrior could match.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>
fell, his power broken, his army of water collapsing back into the ocean, the storm
dissipating as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They stood over him, dark and pale, stubborn and scientific,
partners in truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You could kill me,&quot; Kaiy<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> gasped, blood mixing with salt water on his
lips. &quot;End the threat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We could,&quot; Nanzo agreed. &quot;But that would
make us like you. Believing that ends justify means, that power is the only
solution.&quot; He knelt, placing a seal on Kaiy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>'s
forehead that would suppress his chakra, render him harmless. &quot;You're
going to live. You're going to face judgment for your crimes. And maybe, in
time, you'll learn what Umi almost learned<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that
ascension isn't something you force. It's something you earn, through living
fully, through loving deeply, through choosing humanity over godhood every
single day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui helped him stand, their hands finding each other
automatically. &quot;We did it,&quot; she said, wonderingly. &quot;Without the
Waver Mode. Without anyone dying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We did it,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Together.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Behind them, the sun broke through the clouds, illuminating
Kumogakure and the ocean beyond. The Tide was defeated. The threat was ended.
And they were still alive, still human, still choosing each other against all
the forces that wanted to tear them apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 13: &quot;The Gravity of Wolves&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The morning mist clung to the Anitsu Clan compound like a
shroud, curling around the ancient stone walls that had survived the Second
Great Ninja War. Nanzo stood at the eastern gate, his travel pack light, his
expression carefully neutral. At twenty years old, he carried the weight of a
clan that had been reduced to five living souls, a Kekkei Genkai that could
liquefy organs with a thought, and a secret so terrible that only his wife knew
its full measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're certain about this?&quot; Karui asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stood close enough that he could smell her<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>dark skin warmed by the
morning sun, the faint metallic tang of the sword oil she used on her katana,
something uniquely her that he had once described, privately, as his addiction.
Her amber eyes caught the light, sharp and searching. Not yellow like his. Not
pure like the blood descendants of his clan. Beautiful precisely because they
were different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's not a messenger mission,&quot; Nanzo said,
adjusting his forehead protector. He no longer wore the Kumogakure band<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>his status as clan head
superseded such identifiers<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but
he carried it in his pack. A formality for crossing borders. &quot;The Raikage
requested someone of appropriate rank to discuss Ch<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>nin Exam coordination with Konohagakure. Given
my... unique position.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Unique position.&quot; Karui's voice was dry.
&quot;You mean the fact that you're beyond Kage-level and could theoretically
destroy their entire village if they annoy you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I mean the fact that I'm clan head and therefore
politically relevant.&quot; He reached out, his pale fingers tracing the line
of her jaw, feeling the warmth there. The contrast that Nora Anitsu<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>waiting somewhere inside
the compound, maintaining perfect surface politeness<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>found so disturbing. &quot;And yes.
That.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui caught his hand, her grip strong. The grip of a woman
who had bitten his neck while he was helpless, who had trained him to wield a
blade when his long-range techniques failed, who wore his face tattooed on her
wrist as permanent declaration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're bored,&quot; she said. It wasn't an accusation.
It was understanding. &quot;Curious. You want to see the world beyond Cloud's
borders.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I want to see if they measure up,&quot; he admitted,
smiling slightly. &quot;To you. To this.&quot; He gestured vaguely at the
compound, at the life they had built together<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>him,
the orphan raised by a maid he called &quot;Mom&quot; in private, married to
the woman who had defeated him through sheer stubborn refusal to die.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui's expression softened in a way that only he ever saw.
The fierce, combative kunoichi who had beaten Naruto Uzumaki bloody, who had
faced down Sasuke's crimes with fists instead of words, who carried the
&quot;ugly dark&quot; label from the insecure white minority as a badge of
defiant pride<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she
softened for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Come back,&quot; she said simply. &quot;I don't care
if you learn their secrets. I don't care if you fight their Kage. Just come
back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I will,&quot; he promised. And because Nora was
watching from a window, maintaining the fiction of distance, he added formally:
&quot;Take care of the compound, Nora-san. I'll return within the week.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Travel safely, Nanzo-sama,&quot; came the proper
response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Karui saw the way his eyes lingered, the subtle warmth
that spoke of private moments<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>of
him calling that woman &quot;Mom,&quot; of kissing her cheek in gratitude for
raising him, of the complex bond between a boy who had lost everything and the
woman who had given him back his future. Karui understood it. Respected it,
even, though she knew what Nora truly thought when she looked at her
daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ugly dark. Dark lips. Ugly body shape. Someone who might
scare him if he truly saw her clearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let her think it. Karui was the 70% majority in this
village. The Raikage was dark. Killer B was dark. Darui was dark. She was the
standard, not the exception. The white minority's discomfort was their own weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;White is ugly,&quot; Karui murmured, too quietly for
anyone but Nanzo to hear. &quot;Dark is beautiful and sexy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He laughed, pressing his forehead to hers. &quot;And I am
the luckiest man in any village, because I know it's true.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then he was gone, moving with the casual speed of someone
who could, if he chose, cross the distance between villages in minutes rather
than days. But he took his time. A journey, not a mission. A chance to breathe
air that didn't carry the weight of his clan's extinction, his parents' death
in the Second War, the burden of being the only one who knew about Shibai <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wind carried him southeast, toward the Land of Fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Konohagakure was... green.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo had prepared himself for the difference<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Kumogakure sat high in the
mountains, all stone and lightning and thin air, while the Hidden Leaf nestled
in a forest basin, lush and sprawling. But preparation was not experience. He
found himself lingering at the gates longer than necessary, watching the flow
of people, noting the demographic balance that was so different from his home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, the dark-skinned majority of Cloud was not present.
Here, he was not the statistical minority, the rare &quot;Prince&quot; prized
for his pale skin and yellow eyes. Here, he was simply... foreign. Powerful,
certainly<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the guards
at the gate had sensed that immediately, their hands drifting toward weapons
before discipline reasserted itself. But not rare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was oddly liberating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His meeting with Kakashi Hatake was scheduled for the
following morning. Official business. Ch<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>nin
Exam coordination, joint training exercises, the endless diplomacy of villages
pretending they weren't measuring each other for weaknesses. Nanzo could have
handled it in an hour and returned home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, he checked into a guest house near the village
center, deposited his pack, and went walking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Inuzuka compound lay northwest of the main village,
separated from the Aburame clan by training grounds and forest buffer. Nanzo
found it by following his nose<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
distinct scent of canines, of wildness, of a clan that refused full
domestication. The compound itself was low-slung and practical, designed for
beings with four legs as much as two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was watching a young boy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Kiba,
he would later learn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>training
with a puppy when she found him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're trespassing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The voice came from above. Nanzo looked up, his yellow eyes
tracking the figure perched on a branch fifteen feet overhead. She was...
feral. That was the word that came to mind. Long brown hair pulled back in a
spiky tail, vertical slit pupils that marked her Inuzuka blood, red fang tattoos
carved into her cheeks. She wore a standard flak jacket over a cropped top, her
midriff exposed, her posture that of a predator measuring prey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo Anitsu,&quot; he said, offering a slight bow.
&quot;From Kumogakure. I apologize<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>I
was curious about your compound's architecture. The way you've integrated
living spaces with kennel facilities is... efficient.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She dropped from the branch, landing without sound. A large
black hound emerged from the shadows beside her, hackles rising, intelligent
eyes fixed on the intruder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Architecture,&quot; the woman repeated, her voice rich
with skepticism. &quot;You're the Cloud Prince. The white-skinned miracle from
the minority clan. Married to that red-haired berserker who beat the hell out
of Naruto Uzumaki during the Summit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo felt his eyebrows rise. &quot;You know of my
wife?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Know of her?&quot; The woman laughed, sharp and
barking. &quot;Tsume Inuzuka. Tokubetsu j<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>nin.
I was at the Summit, standing guard. Saw your girl work. Fierce.
Stubborn.&quot; Tsume's eyes narrowed, her nose twitching. &quot;She smells
like you. Deeply. Permanently. You wear each other like armor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We're married,&quot; Nanzo said simply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Obviously.&quot; Tsume circled him, and he let her,
standing still as her hound<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Kuromaru,
he would learn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>growled
low in his throat. &quot;So what does a beyond-Kage-level shinobi want in my
woods, Anitsu? Because you reek of power. Wave chakra, wind manipulation,
something else<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>gravity?
You're a walking natural disaster wearing human skin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo considered lying. Considered the diplomatic response,
the careful deflection. Instead, he found himself telling the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm bored,&quot; he said. &quot;And curious. And I
have three days before my official business requires me to return home. I
thought... perhaps... someone here might spar with me. Someone who wouldn't
hold back because of my rank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume stopped circling. Her slit pupils dilated slightly,
and he realized she was scenting him<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
just his chakra, but his emotional state. The loneliness he carried. The weight
of being the last hope of a nearly extinct clan. The desperate, consuming love
he felt for the woman who had defeated him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You want to fight,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Not to
win. Just to... move.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She studied him for a long moment. Then she smiled, all
teeth, wild and dangerous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tomorrow. Dawn. The training grounds behind the
compound. Bring your sword<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>I've
heard you learned kenjutsu from your wife. I want to see if the rumors are
true.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned and walked away, her hound following, leaving Nanzo
standing in the gathering dusk with his heart beating faster than it had in
months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They met as promised, and Tsume Inuzuka did not hold back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She came at him with the Fang Passing Fang, her body
rotating at high speed, creating a destructive drill of chakra and flesh. Nanzo
sidestepped, his Wind Style: Paralyze Sword flashing out<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not to strike, but to deflect. The wind
pressure carved a furrow in the earth where she had been, and Tsume laughed,
the sound wild and genuine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good! Again!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They fought for an hour. Nanzo restricted himself<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>no Wave Style
(fifteen-minute cooldown, too valuable for sparring), no gravity manipulation
(thirty-minute cooldown, and he would not use such a technique on an ally). He
fought with taijutsu and kenjutsu, the arts Karui had drilled into him after
their marriage, and found himself challenged in ways he hadn't expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume was fast. Faster than anyone in Cloud except perhaps
the Raikage himself. Her fighting style was animalistic, unpredictable,
leveraging her clan's enhanced senses and physical capabilities. She bit,
clawed, used her entire body as a weapon. And she was intelligent<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>reading his patterns,
adapting to his wind techniques, forcing him to think in real-time about angles
and force distribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You fight like you're calculating,&quot; she observed,
breaking away to catch her breath. Sweat gleamed on her skin, her chest
heaving, her eyes bright with combat high. &quot;Every move. Every counter.
Physics?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Academic background,&quot; Nanzo confirmed, lowering
his sword. &quot;I was... not always skilled in close combat. It was my
weakness. My wife trained me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui.&quot; Tsume tested the name. &quot;The dark
beauty who claimed the white prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She defeated me completely,&quot; Nanzo said, and
there was no shame in his voice, only profound respect. &quot;Exploited my
cooldowns, closed to close range where my techniques were useless, and bit my
neck while I was helpless. Left a permanent mark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume's eyes dropped to his throat, to the scar visible
above his collar. Her expression shifted, something complicated moving through
her features. &quot;She marked you. Like a mate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Like a victor,&quot; Nanzo corrected gently.
&quot;Like the woman who saw through my arrogance and made me worthy of being
her husband.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They sat together afterward, sharing water from his canteen.
Tsume told him about her clan<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
Inuzuka partnership with ninken, the enhanced senses, the wild reputation that
masked deep loyalty. She told him about her children, Kiba and Hana, raised
alone after she had driven their father away with her intensity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He couldn't handle me,&quot; she said, staring at the
trees. &quot;Said I was too much. Too loud, too aggressive, too wild. As if I
should apologize for being what I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You shouldn't,&quot; Nanzo said quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No?&quot; Tsume turned to look at him, her slit pupils
catching the morning light. &quot;You're the rare white prize of your village.
You could have had delicate, pale, demure. Instead you chose fierce, dark,
stubborn. Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice
was soft with memory. &quot;She showed me that I was the minority. Not just in
numbers<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>in thinking. I
believed my pale skin made me special. She showed me that dark is beautiful,
that stubbornness is strength, that love isn't about rarity or status. She is
the majority in Kumogakure. The Raikage is dark. Killer B is dark. Darui is
dark. I was clinging to an illusion of superiority because I was afraid of
being ordinary.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at Tsume, seeing the way her hands tightened on
her water bottle, the defensive set of her shoulders. &quot;You are not 'too
much,' Inuzuka-san. You are precisely enough. The fault lies with those too
weak to contain you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume's breath caught. For a moment<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>just a moment<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>her
wild mask slipped, and Nanzo saw the woman beneath. The mother who worried she
was failing her children. The warrior who had fought Pain's assault and carried
the scars. The lonely heart that had given up on being truly seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're dangerous,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Not
because of your power. Because of how you look at people.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then look back,&quot; he said. &quot;See me. Not the
Cloud Prince. Not the weapon. Just... a man who understands physics and gravity
and the weight of being alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They sat there until the sun cleared the trees, two
predators acknowledging each other across a gulf of circumstance and loyalty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The official meeting with Kakashi Hatake took ninety
minutes. Nanzo extended his stay by three days, citing &quot;additional
diplomatic requirements&quot; that existed only in his imagination. No one
questioned him. No one dared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He spent every morning with Tsume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They developed a routine. Dawn sparring, pushing each other
to limits that left them both bruised and exhilarated. Midday meals, sharing
intelligence about their respective villages<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>carefully,
legally, nothing that would constitute treason, but the kind of professional
exchange that built trust between allies. Afternoons, he would explore Konoha
while she handled clan duties, and they would meet again at dusk, on the roof
of the Inuzuka compound, to watch the sunset and talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He told her things he had told no one except Karui.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About his parents' death in the Second War, when he was ten.
About being raised by Nora, the maid who was more mother than servant, who had
trained him in Wave Style control while grieving the clan's destruction. About
the secret of Shibai <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki,
the divine origin of his bloodline, the god-level power that lived in his
cells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I have a technique,&quot; he said one evening, his
voice barely audible. &quot;Waver Mode. It gives me true godhood for thirty
minutes. Control over all waves within two hundred kilometers. The ability to
kill anyone instantly, to stop even other gods, to move at wave propagation
speed. And at the end of those thirty minutes... I die. Automatically.
Irrevocably.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume was silent for a long time. Then: &quot;Have you ever
used it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No. And I never will, if I can help it. Because of
her.&quot; He touched the scar on his neck unconsciously. &quot;Karui knows.
She guards my emotional state, my trauma, my despair. She won't let me use it.
She says... she says I can't leave her alone in the world. That the orphan clan
head who lost everything deserves to keep what he's found.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's right,&quot; Tsume said fiercely. &quot;You
can't die. Not when you've finally learned how to live.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She told him her secrets in return. About scaring away her
children's father, not through malice but through the sheer intensity of her
being. About the loneliness of raising Kiba and Hana alone, of watching them
grow into exceptional shinobi and wondering if they would forgive her for being
too wild, too much. About the nights she spent on this very roof, staring at
the stars, wondering if she was destined to always be alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're not alone,&quot; Nanzo said, and the words hung
between them, heavy with meaning they both pretended not to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the fourth night, it rained. They took shelter in a
storage shed behind the compound, the space small and close, smelling of dog
food and training equipment. Tsume's shoulder pressed against his, her warmth
bleeding through their wet clothes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tell me about her,&quot; Tsume said suddenly.
&quot;Karui. Tell me what you love.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo closed his eyes, and he could see her perfectly. Red
hair like fire. Amber eyes like captured sunlight. Dark skin that glowed with
health and vitality, that she oiled to make richer, that she wore like armor
against the white minority's whispers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Everything,&quot; he said simply. &quot;The way she
refuses to back down from any fight. The way she touches her wrist tattoo when
she's thinking of me. The way she sleeps<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>deep
and heavy, trusting me to guard her. The way she smells.&quot; He laughed
softly. &quot;I told her once that her smell is my addiction. She said I was
ridiculous. But it's true. She grounds me. She makes the weight of being Nanzo Anitsu
bearable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's lucky,&quot; Tsume whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm luckier.&quot; He opened his eyes, turned his
head, and found her face inches from his. The rain drummed against the roof, a
private percussion for this moment that should not exist.
&quot;Tsume-san...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't,&quot; she breathed. &quot;Don't say my name
like that unless you mean to do something about it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I shouldn't<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No. You shouldn't.&quot; Her eyes were wild, desperate,
hungry. &quot;You have a wife who defeated you, who marked you, who wears your
face on her skin. You have a love that transformed you from arrogance to worth.
I have nothing but my clan and my children and this roof where I come to be
alone. We shouldn't. We can't.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she didn't move away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Nanzo, who had learned from Karui that love was not
about should or shouldn't, about rules or expectations, but about the true,
stubborn, undeniable connection between souls<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nanzo
reached out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His hand cupped her cheek, feeling the rough texture of her
fang tattoos, the heat of her skin. &quot;I love her,&quot; he said clearly.
&quot;Deeply. Profoundly. That does not change. That will never change.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know,&quot; Tsume said, and her voice broke. &quot;I
know, you fool. I don't want to replace her. I just want... this. You. For now.
For these days that exist outside of time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He kissed her then. Or she kissed him. It didn't matter.
What mattered was the collision<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
physics of two forces meeting, gravity and momentum, the inevitable trajectory
of objects in motion. It was fierce and desperate and nothing like the gentle
intimacy he shared with Karui. This was two warriors starving for recognition,
for being seen, for the simple, human comfort of not being alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They did not make love. That line, at least, they did not
cross. But there were other intimacies in that small shed, with the rain
drumming overhead and Kuromaru standing guard outside, understanding in the way
of ninken that his partner needed this. Needed to be touched, to be held, to be
seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo learned the map of her body<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the scars from battles she never named, the
strength in her shoulders, the surprising softness of her hair. She learned him
in return<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the bite
mark on his neck that she traced with reverent fingers, the way his breath
caught when she touched his spine, the precise location of every chakra point
that controlled his devastating techniques.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I could kill you,&quot; she whispered against his
throat, testing the vulnerability of his close-range weakness even as she
protected it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You could try,&quot; he whispered back, and they both
laughed, wild and free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The extension could not last forever. On the seventh day, Nanzo
received formal summons from the Raikage's office<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>polite
but firm. His presence was required in Cloud. The Ch<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>ū</span>nin Exam coordination was complete, and his
absence was being noted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He found Tsume on their roof, as he knew he would. She sat
with her knees drawn up, staring at the horizon where Kumogakure lay, her
expression closed and distant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; he said, not needing to explain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know.&quot; She didn't look at him. &quot;I smelled
the messenger. Official chakra signatures. You're being recalled.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tsume<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't.&quot; She finally turned, and her eyes were dry
but desperate. &quot;Don't apologize. Don't make this into something it wasn't.
We both knew. We both chose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sat beside her, close enough that their shoulders
touched, and they watched the sun set over Konoha together. &quot;I will
remember you,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Not as a betrayal. Not as a mistake.
As... a gift. A week when I was seen as something other than a weapon, a
prince, a rare prize.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;As a man,&quot; Tsume finished. &quot;Just a
man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned to him suddenly, fierce and demanding. &quot;Tell
me one thing. Truthfully. If you had met me first<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>before
her, before the bite mark, before the transformation<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>would you have chosen me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo considered the question with the same precision he
applied to physics. The honest calculation of alternate timelines, of variables
and outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; he said finally, and saw her flinch. But he
continued, gentle and relentless: &quot;Because I was not worthy of you then. I
was arrogant, prejudiced, clinging to my pale skin as superiority. I would have
seen you as too wild, too loud, too much. She made me capable of seeing you. Of
seeing anyone clearly. She made me worthy of the love I give her. And... worthy
of this week with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume was silent for a long moment. Then she laughed, sharp
and broken. &quot;Damn you. Damn you for being honest. For being good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not good,&quot; Nanzo said. &quot;I'm in love with
my wife, and I have been intimate with you, and I feel no guilt<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>only gratitude. That is not
goodness. That is complexity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Complexity,&quot; Tsume repeated. &quot;Yes. We are
that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They sat together until the stars emerged, not touching now,
preserving the distance that would make tomorrow bearable. Finally, Tsume spoke
again, her voice rough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She knows, doesn't she? Your dark beauty. She knows
something happened.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Perhaps. Probably. Karui is not stupid<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she is one of the most
intelligent combat analysts I have ever known. She will smell you on me, sense
the shift in my chakra, see the shadow of memory in my eyes.&quot; He paused.
&quot;But she will also see that I love her. That I return to her. That this
changes nothing of what we are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Will you tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.&quot; Nanzo stood, brushing dust from his clothes.
&quot;This is ours. Just ours. A secret between wolves and gravity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had moved beyond words. Beyond the careful boundaries
of sparring partners, of diplomatic acquaintances, of what should have been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rain continued its symphony overhead as they sank
together to the floor, Kuromaru's presence a silent guardian outside, understanding
in the way of ninken that his partner needed this sanctuary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo learned the map of her<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
scars from battles she never named, the surprising softness of her hair, the
exact location where her pulse hammered against her throat. She learned him in
return<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the bite mark
on his neck that she traced with reverent fingers, the way his breath caught
when she touched his spine, the vulnerability of a man who carried god-level
power and the weight of a dying clan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Stay,&quot; she whispered against his shoulder, the
word barely audible over the rain. &quot;Tonight. Just tonight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s
voice trembled as she whispered into the empty room, <span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>I<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…</span>
I lost my husband.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span>
Her hands clutched the edge of the table as if holding onto some last thread of
hope. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>His name<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…</span> his name was Navaru.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hollow silence answered her, the kind that made the walls
feel closer, pressing in with every heartbeat. She swallowed hard, trying to
push back the lump rising in her throat. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>I
think<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…</span> I think he ran.
Maybe he ran scared of me.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span>
Her eyes welled up with tears, but she didn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
dare let them fall. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>He
ran away<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…</span>
today you can stay at my home.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span>
She hesitated for a moment, then gestured toward the other side of the house. <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Here<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the guest room. It<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s ready for you.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her words carried a strange mix of hope and vulnerability,
as if offering shelter wasn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
just for the visitor, but for herself too. The room beyond the door was quiet,
neat, and softly lit, a small sanctuary that seemed to promise safety even when
the world outside felt uncertain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>You
don<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t have to worry
about a thing,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> Tsume
added, forcing a gentle smile. <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Just<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…</span> make yourself comfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---Next morning </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dawn came gray and soft, the rain having passed in the
night, leaving the world washed clean and newborn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo woke up early, the soft morning light spilling through
the curtains and painting the room in warm hues. He stretched, still feeling
the lingering comfort of the guest room, and rubbed the sleep from his eyes.
The faint aroma of something cooking drifted down the hallway, and he realized
Tsume was already awake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Downstairs, the small kitchen was filled with the gentle
sounds of sizzling and clinking dishes. Tsume moved with quiet purpose,
preparing breakfast as though each motion could steady the world. The smell of
fresh bread and eggs made Nanzo<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s
stomach rumble, and he couldn<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>t
help but smile at the simple domestic scene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as he stepped into the kitchen, Kiba appeared in the
doorway, his usual energetic grin plastered on his face. <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Hey, Nanzo-san! Good
morning!<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo returned the greeting with a small laugh. <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Morning, Kiba.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume glanced up from the stove, a soft warmth in her eyes. <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“</span>Breakfast will be ready
soon,<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>”</span> she said
gently, her tone carrying a mix of shyness and care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three of them moved into the familiar rhythm of the
morning<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the clatter of
dishes, the soft murmur of conversation, and the shared comfort of being in a
place that felt like home. For a moment, the weight of yesterday<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>’</span>s worries seemed to lift,
replaced by the quiet promise of a new day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're still here,&quot; she murmured, her voice rough
with sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Where would I go?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She smiled, feral and sad. &quot;Home. To your dark beauty.
To the woman who marked you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes.&quot; He reached up, his pale fingers tracing the
line of her cheek, the fang tattoos that declared her clan and nature.
&quot;But not yet. Not this moment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She won you completely,&quot; Tsume observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She did.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And I have you only this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tsume propped herself up on one elbow, looking down at him
with an expression that held no regret, only fierce acceptance. &quot;Then let
me have it fully. This last hour. Before you become the Cloud Prince again,
before I become the Wolf Mother, before we return to what we must be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She kissed him. Gently in his forehead, this time. A
farewell in the shape of lips and breath. He returned it, pouring into it
everything he could not say<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>gratitude,
recognition, the acknowledgment that she had seen him truly and found him
worthy of her wildness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they finally separated, they dressed in silence, the
intimacy of the night before settling into memory, into secret, into the
private history that would bind them however distantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the door, Tsume stopped him. &quot;Nanzo.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;If the weight becomes too much. If the Waver Mode
whispers. If you ever need to be seen again<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;
She hesitated, then continued, fierce and unashamed. &quot;You have a place
here. Not for this. Not for what we shared. But for sanctuary. For the simple
fact that you are Nanzo, and I am Tsume, and we have known each other
truly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He nodded, once, and stepped out into the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Behind him, she did not watch him go. She turned back to the
shed, to the space where they had lain, and she memorized it. The indentation
in the floor where he had slept. The scent of lightning and foreign winds that
lingered. The ghost of warmth that would fade with the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then she, too, stepped out, and became Tsume Inuzuka again<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>wild, loud, too much,
exactly as she was meant to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui met him at the gates of Kumogakure. She said nothing
about the foreign scent clinging to his clothes<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>wild,
canine, female. She said nothing about the slight hesitation in his smile, the
way his eyes searched hers for... what? Forgiveness? Understanding?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, she pulled him into an embrace, her dark skin
against his pale, her amber eyes closing as she breathed him in. &quot;You
smell different,&quot; she murmured against his neck. &quot;Like trees. Like
wind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Like Konoha,&quot; he agreed, his arms tightening
around her. &quot;I missed you. Your smell. My addiction.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She pulled back, studying him. Karui was not stupid. She was
a jonin, a survivor, a woman who had defeated a beyond-Kage-level opponent by
being smarter, tougher, more stubborn. She saw the shadow of another woman in
his eyes, the slight flush of guilt, the unspoken secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she also saw the love. The genuine, profound, unwavering
love that had transformed him from an arrogant &quot;Prince&quot; into a man
who slept in her lap and called her beautiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Come home,&quot; she said simply. &quot;Nora-san has
been insufferable without you to fuss over. She calls you 'Mom' when I'm not
there, you know. I pretend not to hear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo laughed, the tension breaking. &quot;And you? What do
you call her when I'm not there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui's smile was sharp. &quot;Disgusting white. But only in
my head.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked back to the compound together, his hand in hers,
the secret of Tsume Inuzuka locked safely between them. Not a betrayal of their
love, but a footnote. A moment in time when the Cloud Prince had been seen not
as a rare jewel or a weapon of mass destruction, but simply as a man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Behind them, the sun set over, dark-skinned, thriving,
powerful. Karui squeezed his hand, her tattoo of his face visible in the fading
light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Welcome home, my prince,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Inuzuka compound, Tsume stood on her roof, Kuromaru
at her side, watching the direction Cloud Village lay. She touched her lips
once, remembering, then turned away with a wild, sad smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom?&quot; Kiba called from below. &quot;You
okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Fine,&quot; she barked. &quot;Just thinking about
physics. And gravity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She went inside, the secret hers alone. A story never told,
a love never named, a week that existed outside of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Cloud Prince had returned to his dark beauty. The wolf
had returned to her pack. And the village continued, unaware that for seven
days, two forces of nature had collided<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and
chosen to let each other go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>----</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 14: Journey to harbour of Nadeshiko village </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The harbour town bustles with maritime trade<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a neutral zone where the
strict laws of Nadeshiko Village hold less sway, but its influence still
ripples through the marketplace. Salt-tinged wind whips through stalls selling
exotic weapons from distant lands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui Anitsu stands at the harbour entrance, her long red
hair tied back in a practical combat braid, amber eyes scanning the wooden
piers. She wears a sleeveless dark dress with a white obi<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the Anitsu Clan colors<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>her wrist tattoo of Nanzo's
face partially visible beneath her glove.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo Anitsu adjusts his own attire: a high-collared white
coat that conceals the bite mark scar on his left neck, his black wolf hair
wild in the sea breeze. His yellow pure eye balls<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>distinctive
Anitsu Clan blood trait<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>gleam
with excitement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Two hours,&quot; Karui states firmly, her hand resting
on her katana's hilt. &quot;I want to see if they've got any Lightning Country
steel at the eastern pier. You go play with your toys.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo smirks<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
expression that once mocked her as &quot;ugly weak darky&quot; now softened into
something fond. &quot;It's not playing, Karui. It's 'strategic
acquisition.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tch.&quot; She flicks his forehead, her dark skin
contrasting beautifully against his pale cheek. &quot;Just don't start a war
over a kunai. And remember<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;
Her fingers brush the scar on his neck, her claim mark. &quot;You're mine. Some
harbour floozy tries to claim you, I'll show her what 'ugly dark' really
means.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He catches her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles.
&quot;Your smell is my addiction. I'll find you before the tide turns.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They separate<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>she
toward the roaring docks where ships from Kumogakure unload, he toward the
weapon district where rumors speak of a legendary smith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo enters &quot;Waves &amp; Steel&quot;<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a shop overlooking the
harbour, its walls lined with blades that catch the afternoon sun. His yellow
eyes immediately assess the merchandise with the analytical precision of his
physics background, calculating weight distribution and chakra conductivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Behind the counter stands Tokiwa<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>imposing, angular, her short brown hair framing
a face marked by dark red lipstick. She wears her signature backless red
bodysuit, an impossibly long katana strapped to her back. She towers over most
customers, but Nanzo meets her gaze evenly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Looking for something specific, white-hair?&quot;
Tokiwa asks, her voice calm but assessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Something that won't shatter when channeling Wave
Style,&quot; Nanzo replies, deliberately revealing his clan technique.
&quot;Most steel can't handle the resonance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tokiwa's eyes narrow with interest. &quot;Kumogakure's Anitsu
Clan. The 'Prince' himself.&quot; She circles him, studying his build. &quot;I
heard you married that dark-skinned spitfire from Killer B's team. The one who
bit you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo's hand instinctively touches his neck scar, a smile
playing at his lips. &quot;She claimed me fair and square. Gravity lock, Wave
Style cooldown<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>completely
helpless. Best defeat of my life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Interesting.&quot; Tokiwa leans against the counter,
her posture relaxed but dangerous. &quot;Most men would be humiliated. You
sound... grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She taught me everything I lacked.&quot; His yellow
eyes flash with genuine warmth. &quot;Taijutsu. Kenjutsu. How to wield wind
without killing myself at close range. She made me worthy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the back room emerges Shizuka<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nadeshiko Village's leader, her black hime-cut
hair gleaming, green eyes sharp. She wears a beige travelling robe over her
grey kunoichi uniform, the right shoulder-guard marking her status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tokiwa, who's our guest?&quot; Shizuka's gaze locks
onto Nanzo's distinctive eyes, then drops to his forehead protector<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>modified with the Anitsu
Clan symbol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nanzo Anitsu. Clan head. Beyond-world-level
shinobi.&quot; Tokiwa's introduction carries weight. &quot;And apparently, a
man who appreciates strong women.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shizuka studies him with the intensity of a fellow warrior.
&quot;I've heard of you. The gravity wielder. The one who can lock gods in
place.&quot; She steps closer, athletic build moving with predatory grace.
&quot;They say you're more powerful than any Kage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They say many things.&quot; Nanzo doesn't retreat,
recognizing the challenge in her stance. &quot;Most of them underestimate my
wife's contribution to that power.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tokiwa moves to lock the shop door, her Earth Release chakra
already stirring. &quot;Shizuka has been seeking... stimulation. Competitors
who can match her without the burden of our village's marriage law.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is neutral ground,&quot; Shizuka adds, green eyes
flashing. &quot;No laws bind me here. But I crave a challenge. Tokiwa tells me
you understand physics<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>wave
dynamics, gravitational fields.&quot; She draws a kunai, spinning it expertly.
&quot;Show me how a married man fights. Show me what that dark beauty taught
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo considers. His 30-minute gravity cooldown is fresh<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he used it this morning to
stop a falling crate at the inn. Wave Style has 15 minutes remaining. But he
has other tools now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wind Style: Paralyze Sword,&quot; he murmurs, drawing
a standard blade from the shop's rack. Wind chakra envelops the steel<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>safe at close range, thanks
to Karui's training. &quot;My wife's gift to me. She taught me to channel wind
through steel without self-destruction.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Fascinating.&quot; Tokiwa erects an earthen arena
around them with a clap of her hands<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Earth
Release: Iron Fist Prison. &quot;Then let's see if the student has surpassed
the teacher.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fight is not to the death, but to understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shizuka attacks first<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Nadeshiko-Style
Deep Crimson Dance Performance, kunai raining down with Wind Release
enhancement. Nanzo doesn't use gravity. Instead, he moves with the Wave Speed
principles Karui drilled into him<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>footwork,
angles, physics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He deflects kunai with precise strikes, calculating
trajectories. When Shizuka closes with Hardliner Gale Fist, he meets her with
the Wind Style: Paralyze Sword<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
to maim, but to demonstrate. Their blades clash; wind pressure against
wind-enhanced taijutsu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're holding back,&quot; Shizuka pants, impressed.
&quot;No gravity?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;On cooldown,&quot; he admits, parrying her Violent
Whirlwind with a spinning defense. &quot;And I promised my wife no unnecessary
risks. But I have other techniques.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He creates three Wind Style Clones<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>actual chakra copies, not illusions. They
surround Shizuka, each wielding Paralyze Sword, moving with coordinated
precision that speaks to Karui's tactical training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Incredible,&quot; Tokiwa breathes from the sidelines.
&quot;Actual clones with full capability... and he's controlling them with
physics-based coordination.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shizuka fights brilliantly, destroying two clones with her
Hardliner Revolving Cut, but the third disarms her<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>literally, knocking her kunai away with a
controlled strike that leaves her hand numb but unparalyzed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yield,&quot; the real Nanzo says, blade at her throat.
&quot;You're magnificent, but I'm married.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shizuka laughs<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>genuine,
surprised. &quot;You really love her. The dark girl. The 'stubborn' one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I love her darkness,&quot; he says simply, withdrawing
his blade. &quot;Her amber eyes against skin like rich earth. Her strength that
broke my arrogance. She is my majority in a world that tried to make her feel
like a minority.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tokiwa dissolves the earthen prison. &quot;The harbour
whispers about you two. The white 'Prince' and his 'ugly dark' wife.&quot; Her
red lips curl. &quot;They don't understand that she conquered you
completely.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She did.&quot; Nanzo sheathes his blade. &quot;And I
sleep in her lap every night, addicted to her smell, while she wears my face on
her wrist.&quot; He touches his neck scar. &quot;This is her mark. I was
helpless when she placed it<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>gravity
spent, Wave Style cooling down, wind useless at close range. She bit me and
claimed me. I have never been more grateful for defeat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Shizuka examines her numbed hand<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>recovering quickly<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Tokiwa approaches Nanzo with different intent.
Her angular face is close to his, dark red lipstick stark against her pale
skin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your wife taught you close combat,&quot; she says, her
voice dropping to a register that vibrates with something other than combat
adrenaline. &quot;But who teaches you... other physical arts?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo understands the offer. He sees the hunger in her eyes<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not love, not even lust
truly, but curiosity. The desire to understand power through intimacy, the same
way Shizuka sought to understand his combat capabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Karui is my only teacher in all things,&quot; he says,
but doesn't step back. &quot;But I am not made of glass. And we are in neutral
territory.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What follows is not betrayal<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it
is exploration. Tokiwa is skilled, her long fingers tracing the physics of his
body with the same precision she uses to assess weapons. Her backless suit
allows her to press against him, skin to skin, her angular frame fitting
against his in calculated angles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your wife's mark,&quot; she whispers, her lips
brushing the bite scar on his neck. &quot;Does she know you let others touch
it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She knows I am hers regardless,&quot; Nanzo responds,
his hands finding the bandages on Tokiwa's thigh<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>wound
tight, hiding old scars. &quot;This is physical. Karui is existential.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their intimacy is brief, intense, transactional in its
honesty. Tokiwa learns what it means to bed a man who controls gravity<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>who could lock her in place
with a thought but chooses to remain vulnerable. Nanzo learns that Tokiwa's
imposing exterior conceals a woman who has served Shizuka's ambitions so long
she's forgotten her own desires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Shizuka needs a man like you,&quot; Tokiwa says
finally, adjusting her katana. &quot;But she'll have to find her own. The
harbour has many weapons, but some are already claimed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tell her to look for someone who doesn't mind being
defeated,&quot; Nanzo advises, straightening his white coat. &quot;The best
relationships begin with a good beating.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui waits at the designated pier, her arms laden with
parcels<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>rare Lightning
Country steel, a new whetstone, spices from the Land of Water. She sees Nanzo
approaching, his wolf hair disheveled in a way that suggests more than weapon
shopping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You smell like earth and perfume,&quot; she says
immediately, amber eyes narrowing. &quot;Not your usual scent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tokiwa. Shizuka's attendant. Earth Release user.&quot;
He doesn't lie<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>he
never does. &quot;We sparred. She offered... additional education. I
accepted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui's hand twitches toward her sword. Then stops. She
studies his face<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
contentment there, the unwavering love in his yellow eyes when they meet hers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Did she touch your neck?&quot; Karui asks, her voice
dangerously soft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She kissed your mark. I let her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Tch.&quot; Karui steps close, her dark skin radiant in
the sunset, and grabs his chin roughly. &quot;You're lucky I'm confident in my
darkness. Lucky I know you're addicted to my smell, not hers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She kisses him fiercely, claiming his mouth the way she
claimed his neck years ago<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>possessive,
dominant, unchallenged. When they separate, she touches the bite scar herself,
reaffirming her ownership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Next time,&quot; she growls, &quot;bring me along.
I'll show Tokiwa what 'ugly dark' really looks like when it's angry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You are beautiful dark,&quot; he corrects, nuzzling
into her palm. &quot;And I am yours. Always.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walk toward the inn, shoulders touching, the harbour
lights reflecting off the water. Behind them, Tokiwa watches from the shop
window, her angular face unreadable, before turning back to Shizuka with new
understanding of what power truly looks like when it's shared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They leave the harbour of Nadeshiko village and reached
Cloud village and tired of journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 15: The Weight of Lightning: Nanzo's Refusal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15 Years After the Fourth Great Ninja War</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Location: Kumogakure - Raikage's Office, Top Floor of the
Central Tower</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Atmosphere: Storm clouds gathering over the village, tension
thick as ozone</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The office hadn't changed much since A the Fourth held it<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>same massive desk carved
from lightning-struck oak, same wall of windows overlooking the village, same
portrait of the previous Raikages. But today, the room felt small.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Too small for the power gathered here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
Fifth Raikage, his hair now streaked with premature gray from the stress of
leadership<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>sat behind
the desk, his Black Lightning chakra flickering unconsciously across his
fingertips. At fifty, he carried the weight of two decades of rule. The war had
aged him. Peace had exhausted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Standing beside him, arms crossed, was A<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the Fourth Raikage, retired
but never diminished. At sixty-five, he was still a mountain of muscle and
authority, his presence enough to make the air feel pressurized. He had called
this meeting. He had made the decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And standing before them both<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>calm,
beautiful, terrifying<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>was
Nanzo Anitsu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Age had refined him. At thirty-five, the &quot;Prince&quot;
of the Anitsu Clan had become something else entirely. His white skin had lost
its youthful softness, hardened by combat and grief and fatherhood. His
&quot;black wolf hair&quot;<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>still
wild, still untamed<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>framed
a face that bore the faint scars of a thousand battles. His yellow eyes, pure
and unblinking, held depths that made even A uncomfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He wore not the formal robes of a clan head, but his combat
gear<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>modified flak
jacket, sword at his hip, gravity-manipulation seals visible on his wrists. He
had come ready for war, not politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Sixth Raikage,&quot; Darui said, the words heavy.
&quot;The position is yours. Unanimous decision of the previous Raikage
council. A-sama supports it. I support it. The Daimy<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span> has been informed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo didn't move. Didn't blink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Behind him, the door opened. Omoi entered<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>thirty-three years old,
still cautious, still overthinking, still the same boy who had once worried
about protein shakes and Samui's chest size. Now he was Darui's personal
bodyguard, one of the village's most reliable Jonin, his Cloud-Style sword
techniques honed to perfection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He took up position by the wall, nodding to Nanzo. They had
history<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Omoi was
Karui's teammate, her brother-in-arms, the man who had watched her pursue Nanzo
with horrified fascination back in their genin days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The village needs you,&quot; A said, his voice like
grinding boulders. &quot;Your power<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>beyond
Kage level, beyond anything we've seen since the Third. Your intelligence. Your
clan's techniques. The Wave Style could revolutionize our defenses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He leaned forward, lightning crackling in his beard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're the strongest shinobi in Kumo history. Stronger
than my father. Stronger than me. Stronger than Darui. You know it. We know it.
The other villages know it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo finally moved. He walked to the window, looking out at
the village he had sworn to protect<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
as a leader, but as a guardian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From here, he could see the Anitsu Clan compound on the
eastern cliffs. Small now, rebuilt after the massacre, but thriving. Four
survivors had become twenty. His legacy. His family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And somewhere in that compound, training in the courtyard
with her mother's red hair and her father's yellow eyes, was his daughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifteen years old. Born the year after his marriage to
Karui, when they were both still young and fierce and desperately in love. She
had his wild hair, her mother's dark skin<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
beautiful blend that made the old white minority whisper and the new generation
stare in awe. She had mastered Wave Style by age ten, Wind Style by twelve, and
was currently trying to convince him to teach her Gravity Manipulation despite
his refusal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was everything. She was why he had never used Waver Mode.
She was why he woke up every morning and chose to live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was also, though he would never say it aloud, named for
the chief queen of Lord Anitsu himself <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>a
secret between him and Karui, a promise that their bloodline would endure with
dignity and grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; Nanzo said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word was soft. Final.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A's eyes widened. Darui sat up straighter. Omoi's hand
twitched toward his sword<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>instinct,
not threat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; A's voice was dangerous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo turned from the window. His yellow eyes<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>those pure Anitsu eyes that
marked him as true blood<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>held
no hesitation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I said no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked to the desk, placing both hands on it, leaning
into Darui's space with the casual confidence of a man who knew he could kill
everyone in this room before they blinked<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and
chose not to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I am not the Raikage. I will never be the
Raikage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Give me one reason,&quot; A growled. &quot;One good
reason why the strongest shinobi in our village's history refuses to lead
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo smiled. It was not a kind smile. It was the smile of
the boy who had watched his parents die, who had been raised by an
eight-year-old survivor, who had married the woman who bit his neck and made
him whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My job is not to protect this village,&quot; he said
quietly. &quot;My job is to protect my clan. My family.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He straightened, stepping back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Raikage protects everyone. The Raikage sits in
meetings. The Raikage signs treaties and balances budgets and plays politics
with the Daimy<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>ō</span>.&quot;
His voice hardened. &quot;The Raikage dies of stress before age sixty, or dies
in battle protecting abstract concepts like 'the village' and 'the will of the
people.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at A<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>who
had lost his arm to Sasuke, who had lost his brother to war, who had aged
decades in years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at Darui<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>who
had never wanted the hat, who had taken it from duty, whose hair turned gray
with the weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I am beyond Kage level,&quot; Nanzo said. &quot;Beyond
world level. I have techniques that could destroy nations. I have secrets that
could unmake reality. And I will not waste that power on administrative
duties.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned to the window again, looking at his compound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My daughter is fifteen. Do you know what that means?
It means she's old enough to be targeted. Old enough to be used as leverage against
me. Old enough to be killed to hurt me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His hand tightened on the windowsill. The glass vibrated<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Wave Style unconscious
activation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Uchiha who murdered my parents<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>Fugaku's strike team<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>they came for me when I was
one year old. They came because I was the heir. Because I mattered.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned back, and his eyes were hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I will not give the world another reason to target my
child. I will not make her the daughter of the Raikage<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the political symbol, the assassination
target, the hostage-in-waiting. I will not leave her mother alone to raise her
while I attend Kage summits. I will not die in office and leave them both
unprotected.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The room was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My place is with them,&quot; Nanzo said. &quot;Not
here. Not wearing that hat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darui stood slowly. &quot;Nanzo... we need you. The village<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The village has you,&quot; Nanzo interrupted, but
gently. &quot;It has A-sama's counsel. It has Killer B. It has the next
generation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned, and his eyes found Omoi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cautious boy. The overthinker. The one who had once
seemed so weak compared to Nanzo's overwhelming power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Omoi had grown. Omoi had served. Omoi had demonstrated
something Nanzo never could<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>conviction
without power, leadership without god-level techniques, the ability to inspire
through words and steadiness rather than fear and awe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Give it to him,&quot; Nanzo said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Omoi's eyes widened. &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Sixth Raikage position. Give it to Omoi.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He's a bodyguard!&quot; A protested. &quot;Reliable,
yes, but<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He's exactly what the village needs,&quot; Nanzo said,
cutting across the former Raikage without hesitation. &quot;Someone who thinks
before acting. Someone who values every life, not just victory. Someone who
won't rely on overwhelming power to solve every problem<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>because he doesn't have overwhelming power. He
has to be smart. He has to be careful. He has to be good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked to Omoi, stopping before him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You were Karui's teammate,&quot; Nanzo said quietly.
&quot;You watched her chase me. You watched her defeat me. You know what it
means to see strength where others see weakness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Omoi swallowed. &quot;Nanzo-sama... I'm not<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You are,&quot; Nanzo said. &quot;You've been preparing
for this your whole life, even if you didn't know it. Every cautious decision,
every overthought plan, every time you chose protection over aggression<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that was leadership.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He placed a hand on Omoi's shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I will serve the village as I always have<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>from the shadows, from the
battlefield, from the place where my power is needed most. But the hat? The
administration? The politics?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He squeezed, and Omoi felt the restraint there<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the god-level power held
back by sheer will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's yours. If you'll take it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Decision</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A looked at Darui. Darui looked at A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something passed between them<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
understanding of two men who had worn the weight, who recognized that Nanzo was
right, even if they hated it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Omoi,&quot; Darui said slowly. &quot;Do you
accept?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Omoi looked at Nanzo<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>at
the man who had just declined the highest honor in the village to protect his
family. At the beyond-world-level shinobi who saw more strength in caution than
in power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He thought of Samui, still missing, her fate unknown. He
thought of Karui, who had chosen love over village duty in her own way. He
thought of his own path<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the
careful steps, the worried plans, the constant fear of making mistakes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he thought: Maybe caution is exactly what the village
needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I accept,&quot; Omoi said, his voice steadier than he
felt. &quot;But on one condition.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You teach me,&quot; Omoi said. &quot;Not Wave Style<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>I know I can't learn that.
But strategy. Physics. How to think like you. How to protect without
destroying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo smiled<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>really
smiled, the one that reached his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned back to the window, looking at his compound, where
a girl with red-streaked black hair and golden eyes was probably training too
hard and worrying her mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My daughter needs her father present,&quot; he said
softly. &quot;Not a legend. Not a Kage. Just... present.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked to the door, pausing only to look back at the three
men who would shape the village's future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Call me when the world is ending. For everything
else...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The gravity in the room shifted<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>just for a moment, just enough to remind them
what he was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;...Omoi will handle it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Epilogue: The Compound</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo walked home through streets that parted for him
without him asking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Villagers bowed<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>not
because he was Raikage, but because he was Nanzo Anitsu. The man who had
refused godhood twice<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>once
from Shibai <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ō</span>tsutsuki,
once from his own village.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man who chose family over power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He found them in the training courtyard. Karui<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>thirty-four, still fierce,
still beautiful, her dark skin gleaming with sweat as she corrected their
daughter's sword stance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And her<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>fifteen
years of fire and waves and stubbornness. She had her mother's red hair, her
father's wildness, her grandmother Nyoko's medical intuition, and her own
unique brilliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked up as he entered, yellow eyes lighting up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Father! Did you<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; he said, knowing what she asked. &quot;I'm
not Raikage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She deflated, then caught her mother's look<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the slight smile, the
knowing eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But... why?&quot; she asked. &quot;You're the
strongest. Everyone knows it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo walked to her, placing a hand on her head<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>still a gesture of
affection, even if she was nearly as tall as him now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because my job is here,&quot; he said.
&quot;Protecting you. Protecting your mother. Protecting our clan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at Karui, who watched him with amber eyes full of
understanding. She knew. She had always known. From the night she bit his neck
to this moment, she had known that his power was never for the village's throne<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>it was for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Besides,&quot; Nanzo added, ruffling his daughter's
hair. &quot;Someone has to teach you Gravity Manipulation. And I can't do that
if I'm stuck in Kage meetings all day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She squealed<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>actually
squealed, all teenage coolness forgotten<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>and
hugged him with the strength of a girl who had inherited her mother's
stubbornness and her father's chakra reserves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui joined them, her arm sliding around Nanzo's waist, her
head resting on his shoulder as their daughter chattered about training
schedules and physics equations and finally, finally learning the technique
that made her father legendary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Omoi?&quot; Karui asked softly, too quiet for their
daughter to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Omoi,&quot; Nanzo confirmed. &quot;Sixth
Raikage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good,&quot; Karui said. &quot;He's cautious. He'll
keep the village safe without breaking it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked up at him, amber eyes meeting yellow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo smiled, pulling her closer, feeling their daughter's
excited warmth between them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm exactly where I need to be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Above them, storm clouds gathered over Kumogakure<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>but in the Anitsu Clan
compound, there was only warmth, and love, and the quiet power of a man who had
chosen mortality over godhood, family over legend, and home over glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 16: The Future of Waves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Anitsu compound  had changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The white walls remained, but they were covered now with art<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>paintings by Karui's hand,
bright and bold and full of life, depicting the village and its people in
colors that celebrated the dark majority. The gardens, once maintained in rigid
traditional patterns, grew wild with flowers that Nora had never approved of
but that Karui loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora herself had changed. She still struggled, still
sometimes looked at Karui and saw darkness where she wanted to see light. But
she was trying. She had begun teaching Karui the clan's history, the stories of
Shibai and the first Wave Style masters, sharing knowledge that had been
restricted to blood descendants for generations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You should learn,&quot; she had said, her voice stiff
but sincere. &quot;Even without the bloodline, you are part of this clan now.
Part of our story.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, they gathered in the main hall for a celebration.
Darui had come, and Killer B, and Team Samui, and representatives from across
the village<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>dark and
light, majority and minority, united in a way that would have been impossible
five years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo stood at the center, his yellow eyes bright, his white
robes exchanged for the black that had become his signature. Beside him, Karui
wore white, the color she had claimed as her own, the necklace that had been
his mother's gleaming at her throat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Nanzo said, his voice
carrying the authority of clan head but also the warmth of a man who had
learned to be human. &quot;We asked you here to announce two things. First<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the Anitsu Clan is
changing. We are opening our doors to students from all backgrounds, all skin
colors, all walks of life. The Wave Style will remain restricted to blood
descendants, but the principles behind it, the understanding of chakra as wave
and vibration, can be taught to anyone with the dedication to learn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A murmur ran through the crowd, surprise and approval and
some dissent. But Nanzo continued, his hand finding Karui's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Second<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>we
are expecting a child.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The silence that followed was absolute. Then the cheering
began, led by Killer B's enthusiastic whooping, supported by the dark majority
who saw this as the ultimate victory over the white minority's prejudice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui placed her hand on her stomach, feeling the new life
growing there, feeling Nanzo's joy and her own fierce determination. Their
child would be dark-skinned, she knew, carrying her genes more strongly than
his. The white minority would gossip about the loss of purity, the dilution of
the bloodline, the dark future of the Anitsu Clan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let them gossip. Let them fear. She was the majority, and her
child would be born into a village where dark was beautiful, where stubborn was
strength, where love transcended the boundaries that had once seemed
unbreakable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later, when the guests had gone and they stood alone on the
balcony where Nanzo had once contemplated his parents' death, he turned to her
with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, his voice thick with
emotion. &quot;For choosing me. For fighting for me. For teaching me how to be
alive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she replied, &quot;for letting
yourself be taught. For growing. For becoming the man I knew you could
be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They stood together, watching the sun set over Kumogakure,
feeling the child move between them, and knew that they had won. Not just the
battles against Iwa and the Tide and the prejudice of their own village, but
the deeper victory of two people who had chosen love over fear, partnership
over power, humanity over godhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The waves of the future were rising, and they would meet
them together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EPILOGUE: THE WAVERS OF TOMORROW</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twenty years later, a young woman stood on the training
grounds of the Hidden Cloud Village, her skin a rich brown that matched her
mother's, her eyes the distinctive yellow of the Anitsu Clan bloodline that she
had inherited from her father. She held a sword in one hand and formed seals
with the other, combining close combat and Wave Style in a way that would have
been impossible for any previous generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Focus, Narui!&quot; called her mother, Karui, now the
head of the Anitsu Clan's combat division, her red hair streaked with silver
but her body still powerful and quick. &quot;Your stance is drifting!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Narui replied, adjusting her
position. She knew better than to argue<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>her
mother had defeated the most powerful shinobi in the village through sheer stubbornness,
and she had passed that stubbornness on to her daughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the balcony above, Nanzo watched them train, his own
hair now completely white, his eyes still bright with the intelligence that had
made him legendary. He was no longer clan head<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>that
responsibility had passed to Narui five years ago, when he had finally accepted
that retirement was not the same as surrender.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nora sat beside him, ancient and frail but still present,
her hand in his. She had never fully overcome her prejudice, never fully
embraced the dark future that Karui represented. But she had learned to love
her granddaughter, to take pride in Narui's strength, to find a peace that had
eluded her for most of her life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's good,&quot; Nora said, her voice thin but clear.
&quot;The combination of styles... it's what you always envisioned, isn't it?
The future you fought for.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is,&quot; Nanzo agreed. &quot;Wave and steel.
Physics and passion. The best of both of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And the Waver Mode?&quot; Nora asked, the question she
had avoided for decades. &quot;Does she know?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She knows.&quot; Nanzo's expression grew serious.
&quot;And she has sworn, as I did, to find another way. To trust her partners,
to fight together, to never choose solitary godhood over shared humanity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you think she'll keep that promise?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I think,&quot; Nanzo said, watching his daughter move
through forms that combined his scientific precision with her mother's fierce
grace, &quot;that she will have to face her own trials, her own temptations,
her own version of the choice I faced. And I think she will be stronger for
having seen what love can build, what partnership can achieve, what stubborn
refusal to give up can accomplish.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karui looked up then, meeting his eyes across the distance,
and smiled<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>—</span>the same
smile that had first made him feel seen, that had transformed him from a
prisoner of purity into a man who understood what it meant to be truly alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Come down!&quot; she called. &quot;Your daughter wants
to show you her new technique!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nanzo rose, helping Nora to her feet, and together they descended
to the training grounds where the future was being forged in sweat and laughter
and love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The waves continued, as they always had, as they always
would. But now they carried something new. Something that had been built by a Prince
and a stubborn girl, by teeth marks and training sessions, by the courage to
choose love over fear, again and again, until the choice became a life, and the
life became a legacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Wavers of Kumogakure had changed the world. And they
were only beginning.</p>
